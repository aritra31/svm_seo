Search Relevance Optimization - Information Retrieval

This project explores search relevance optimization for a large-scale help center by improving document retrieval quality for real user queries. I built and evaluated a hybrid retrieval approach combining lexical and semantic signals, tested on real-world queries, and measured performance using recall-based metrics to assess coverage and ranking quality. The work focuses on practical tradeoffs between relevance, scalability, and system constraints in production search systems.
