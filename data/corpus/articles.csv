If you're using a template , review the survey to customize questions and answer choices so it's relevant to your survey goals. For example, you can add the specific product or company name you're looking for feedback on. You may also want to add new questions or delete questions that aren't useful to you. Apply Logic After your survey questions and pages are set up, it's a good time to apply logic to the survey. Logic can help you get better data by creating a more personalized survey experience for respondents. For example, you can use question skip logic to control which questions respondents will see next based on their answers to previous questions. Or, you can use question randomization to reduce potential bias in the order questions are presented. Brand or Customize the Survey After your questions and logic are in place, you can focus on fine-tuning the look and feel of your survey with our design and display options . For example, show or hide elements on the survey page, add a logo , or create a custom theme . Preview and Collaborate Always preview your survey before sending it to respondents so you can catch any mistakes or logic issues . If you want to work with others on your survey’s design, sending it out, or reviewing results you can share the survey . Or, if you’re looking for some feedback on your survey design, invite others to give feedback . Once you're survey is ready to send out to respondents, create a collector to get responses.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/invoice-billing/,How to Pay by Invoice,"How to Pay by Invoice How Invoicing Works Choosing Invoice During Checkout Switching Your Account to Invoicing How to Pay by Invoice How to Pay by Invoice How Invoicing Works Choosing Invoice During Checkout Switching Your Account to Invoicing How Invoicing Works If you'd like to be emailed an invoice to pay manually rather than be auto-charged for your subscription, you can pay by invoice. Invoicing is available for annual plans only. Here's how it works: We’ll email you and your billing contact an invoice after you sign up. When it's time to renew , we'll email you the next invoice to pay 45 days before your renewal. The payment methods you can use and any special instructions will be right there on the invoice. If you’re paying the invoice by credit or debit card, make sure not to check the box to ""make this the default payment method"" or it’ll switch you to auto-pay! You need to keep auto-renew turned on to be emailed an invoice. This doesn’t mean we auto-charge you! It just means we can automatically create an invoice to email you. If you turn auto-renew off, we won’t create you an invoice and your account will downgrade at your renewal date. Just make your payment by the renewal date and you’ll be all set! If your payment arrives a little late, don’t worry—you won’t lose access to your account, surveys, or data right away (we have a short grace period). But you might not be able to download results until your payment arrives. After some time has passed and we don't get your payment, your account will downgrade to a free plan, but you can upgrade again whenever. Choosing Invoice During Checkout When you sign up for a paid plan, the payment methods you can choose from are all right there on the SurveyMonkey checkout page after you choose your billing country. Select Invoice on the checkout page, confirm your subscription, then go to your Transaction History and click Pay Invoice. You can use paid features as soon as your payment is processed . Switching Your Account to Invoicing If you've already got a paid account and you want to switch from having your card auto-charged to being emailed an invoice, no problem! As long as you have an annual plan, we can update your account. To switch to invoicing: Make sure the info in your Billing Details is up to date—your billing email address, postal address, billing contact name, phone number, purchase order number, anything and everything that relates to your payment method. Contact us and let us know you'd like to switch to invoicing. Make sure you understand how invoicing works by reading the info at the top of this article. That's it!

Change the Primary Admin If you can’t log into the Primary Admin account, contact support. The Primary Admin can edit their account details (name, email address, etc.) to the new person's. However, steps to complete this process depend on whether the new person is already on the team: Change to someone who isn't on the team yet To change the Primary Admin: Log into your Primary Admin account in SurveyMonkey. Change the email address on your account to the email address of the person you want to be the new Primary Admin. Change to someone who is on the team Changing the Primary Admin to someone else that's already part of your team is a multi-step process, so we'll start with an example. EXAMPLE In this example, Cindy and Deanna are already part of the same team. Cindy is the Primary Admin, and Deanna is a Full User. Cindy wants to make Deanna the new Primary Admin instead. Here's what needs to happen: 1. Deanna transfers all of her surveys to Cindy's Primary Admin account. 2. Cindy deletes Deanna's Full User account from the team. 3. Cindy changes the email address on her own account to Deanna's email address. 4. Deanna is now the Primary Admin and Cindy is no longer in the team. If you're the current Primary Admin, follow these steps to switch the Primary Admin to someone else that's already on your team: Before you do anything, ask the other person to log in to their account and transfer their surveys to the current Primary Admin account. Log in to the Primary Admin account in SurveyMonkey. Select My Team from the main navigation. Select Manage Users . Find the person who you want to be the new Primary Admin. If their email address is linked to multiple SurveyMonkey accounts, you will need to contact support or choose different email address for the Primary Admin account. Delete their account from the team . Change the email address on your account to the email address of the new person. If the original Primary Admin still needs to be in the team, the new Primary Admin can invite them to fill the open seat at no additional cost. If you change the email address on your account to someone else, you'll lose access to the account and all surveys and data within it. You won't be a part of the team anymore unless the new Primary Admin invites you to join the team. If you can’t log into the Primary Admin account, contact support. The Primary Admin can edit their account details (name, email address, etc.) to the new person's.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/star-rating/,Star Rating Question,"Star Rating Question Star Rating Question Star Rating Question The Star Rating question lets respondents evaluate a statement on a visual scale of stars, hearts, thumbs, or smilies. A weight is assigned to each icon in the scale, so a weighted average is calculated in the Analyze Results section. Creating a Star Rating Question To set up a Star Rating question: Drag and drop Star Rating into your survey from the Build section of the sidebar. Enter your question text. Adjust the settings under the Edit and Options tab. Click Save . Question Settings Under the Edit tab, you can adjust the following settings specific to the Star Rating question. Colors Use the color dropdown to change the icons to yellow, green, blue, red, or black. Spacing Between Icons To make the icons display closer together, you can change the Question Width under the Options tab. However, keep in mind that the Question Width setting applies to surveys on all devices, so a question set to 50% width, for example, would also only take up 50% of the survey's width on mobile devices, which may make the icons look crowded. Additional Options Under the Edit , Options , and Logic tabs, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Add an ""Other"" Answer Option for Comments Require an Answer Add Question Skip Logic Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. Answering the question is easy—to give a rating of 4 stars, for example, a respondent would click the fourth star to select it. The first, second, third, and fourth stars will fill in, and we'll record the answer as the weight assigned to the star they selected. There's no way to enter a half-star rating. TIP! If you send your survey by Email Invitation, you may be able to embed a Star Rating question in your email so respondents can answer with just one click. Analyzing Results Weighted Average By default, the bar chart will reflect the Weighted Average —the average star rating that respondents gave. We calculate this average using the same formula we use to calculate the weighted average for Matrix/Rating Scale questions—see the Analyzing Results section of the Matrix/Rating Scale Question article for details. Chart & Data Table Labels In distribution charts for the Star Rating question, labels display differently depending on how you used rating labels in the survey design: If your Star Rating question has no rating labels, the answer choice labels display the number of stars the respondent selected. For example, the answer choice label for a rating of 2 stars would be 2, the answer choice label for a rating of 3 stars would be 3, and so on. If your question has rating labels for all answer choices, every answer choice label displays the corresponding rating label that you entered in the survey design. If your question has rating labels for some answer choices but not others, the answer choices without rating labels display as (no label). You can edit labels directly on the chart in the Analyze Results section, or go back to the Design Survey section to add rating labels to the question. Chart Scale The axis scale of the weighted average chart may not match the scale of your Star Rating question automatically. To change the scale of your chart, adjust the Min and Max setting in your chart's Display Options. For example, if your Star Rating question uses a scale of 5 stars, change the Max to 5 so that the scales match.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/ranking-question/,Ranking Question,"Ranking Question Ranking Question Ranking Question Ranking Question The Ranking question asks respondents to compare items to each other by placing them in order of preference. In the Analyze Results section, an average ranking is calculated for each answer choice, allowing you to quickly evaluate the most preferred answer choice. Creating a Ranking Question To add this question type: Drag and drop Ranking into your survey from the Build section. In the question text field, write instructions that ask respondents to rank the answer choices in order of preference, 1 being the highest. It may also help to include what all the choices have in common. For instance, ""Rank the following ice cream flavors in order of preference, 1 being your most preferred flavor."" In the Ranking Choices fields, enter the answer options you want respondents to rank. You can add up to 250 answer options. Configure any additional options. Click Save . TIP! Try to limit the number of ranking choices to about 5. Asking respondents to rank too many items in relation to each other can be overwhelming. Add an N/A Option Under the Edit tab, you can choose to add an N/A column , and customize the label. When you add an N/A option to a Ranking question, it will add an N/A checkbox at the end of each row. If a respondent selects an N/A checkbox, that row will be greyed out and will not be included in that respondent's ranking order. It's important to make sure that even the lowest ranked options still apply to that respondent. If a respondent doesn't have the option to declare that a ranking item does not apply to them, they will be forced to include that choice in their rankings anyway, which might produce bad data. Additional Options Under the Options tab, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Require an answer Sort, randomize, or flip rows Change the question size & layout Enable question text A/B test Learn more: Editing Questions Under the Options tab, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Require an answer Sort, randomize, or flip rows Change the question size & layout Enable question text A/B test Learn more: Editing Questions Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. Respondents can drag and drop answer choices in the order of preference. When the N/A option is enabled, you can also use the dropdowns to rank. Analyzing Results See example results (English only) » Average Ranking Ranking questions calculate the average ranking for each answer choice so you can determine which answer choice was most preferred overall. The answer choice with the largest average ranking is the most preferred choice. The average ranking is calculated as follows, where: w = weight of ranked position x = response count for answer choice 1 w 1 + x 2 w 2 + x 3 w 3 ... xnwn ----------------------- Total response count Weights are applied in reverse. In other words, the respondent's most preferred choice (which they rank as #1) has the largest weight, and their least preferred choice (which they rank in the last position) has a weight of 1. You can't change the default weights. For example, if a Ranking question has 5 answer choices, weights are assigned as follows: The #1 choice has a weight of 5 The #2 choice has a weight of 4 The #3 choice has a weight of 3 The #4 choice has a weight of 2 The #5 choice has a weight of 1 We apply weights in this way to ensure that when the data is presented on a chart, it's clear which answer choice is most preferred. If you chose to include an N/A option on the Ranking question, any N/A responses will not factor into the average ranking. Charts The Depth display option allows you to choose between the following options: Weighted Average : Charts the average ranking for each answer choice Distribution : Charts the absolute number or percentage of respondents that selected each answer choice The chart types available depend on the question type, and the display options you configure.

For a quick payment experience, try to make a short and simple form. Prices must be a whole number between $1-$10,000 in most accepted currencies . To create a form that accepts payments with PayPal: Create a survey. From the Design Survey tab, select Options , and then select Payment . Choose PayPal as the payment processor to collect payments. If it’s your first time adding the PayPal Payment option, click Connect to PayPal and follow the instructions to log in or sign up.

PayPal is free and easy to set up, but if you have any issues connecting your accounts you can reach out to the PayPal support team. You can click Manage account from the side panel to open My Account to manage PayPal from Linked Accounts. You can preview the form to see prices appear on the question and the PayPal checkout display, however it isn’t possible to test making a payment and no transactions can be processed while previewing. Editing a form that accepts payment Changes to prices or currency will go into effect immediately for new responses. Editing a question with payment associated may be limited if this form already has responses. TIP! If you have a limited amount of tickets or items that you want to accept payment for, you can add a quota to your form. Once the quota has been met, the form closes and respondents won't see the payment page. Turning Off Payments You can stop accepting payments from your form at any time by closing your form. If you delete the form question associated with payments after you’ve collected responses, you will also delete any transaction records from previous payments in the Analyze Results section. You'll always be able to see your complete transaction record in your PayPal account. If you disconnect your PayPal account in My Account , you won't be able to collect any additional payments from your forms or surveys. Currency Options Forms creators can only charge in the following currencies: AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NOK, NZD, SEK, SGD, and USD. People taking your survey have plenty of options to pay . Collecting Responses After you design your form, create a collector to send it out and start accepting payments. You can send a form with a payment page using any collector type , except for Audience, Mobile SDK, and Offline Mode. After a respondent submits a payment, they won't be able to return to the form even when Response Editing is on. Viewing Payment Transactions and Responses When someone submits a payment through your form, PayPal collects all of the details from the payment page, which means SurveyMonkey never saves or stores any credit card numbers. You can go to the Analyze Results section of your form to see the transactions made along with responses in your Question summary or Tabular view. You'll find them at the very bottom of your form results. The Payment Summary shows: PayPal’s Charge ID The amount paid The date and time The item description The respondent's first and last name The transaction status This is only a snapshot of each payment taken at the time the form is completed. To view real-time purchase totals, make refunds, and transfer funds to your bank account, log in to PayPal . Making a Payment When someone submits a payment through your form, they'll receive an email from PayPal confirming their transaction. Transactions appear on their credit or debit card statements with the name of your form. SurveyMonkey's platform allows you to integrate with third-party payment processors. Some of these payment processors may require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) under the EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2) . People in Europe who submit payment through your form may need to provide additional authentication. It's not possible to disable this authentication when payment processors require it. If someone runs into issues making payment, they can reach out to PayPal or the form owner for assistance.

Advanced Piping lets you insert text like custom variables , custom data from Contacts , or a respondent's answer to a previous question into your survey—allowing you to personalize your survey questions for each unique respondent based on who they are and how they answer certain questions in your survey. Advanced Piping is related to Question & Answer Piping , which is a simpler version of this feature that only lets you insert text from one data source: previous questions in the survey. Adding Advanced Piping To use Advanced Piping: Click the textbox you want to insert text into. See a list of the supported fields below. Click Insert text from... . Select a data source from the menu. You can choose from previous questions, contacts, or custom variables. When you insert text from one of the available data sources into your survey, the following syntax is inserted into the textbox: {{ expression }} When a respondent takes your survey, the output of the expression will replace the brackets based on their unique answers, or the custom data or custom variables associated with them. Supported Fields Available Data Sources You can reference the following data sources in the Advanced Piping expressions you create. Some data sources are only supported when you send your survey to respondents through specific collector types, as noted below. You can't pipe questions into page 1 of a survey, but you can pipe custom data from contacts and custom variables into page 1. If you have anonymous responses turned on for your Email Invitation collector, it's not possible to use custom data from contacts for Advanced Piping. Sources Previewing & Testing Advanced Piping The best ways to test Advanced Piping before sending your survey to respondents differs depending on the data sources you reference in your Advanced Piping expressions. Testing Piping Based on Questions If all of the Advanced Piping in your survey is based on a respondent's answer text, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on which answer choices you select.

When you create a test group, include email addresses that you have access to for testing. When you add custom data to those contacts, make sure that you fill in all the Custom Data fields that you based Advanced Piping on. For example, if you use the Custom 1 field to record each contact's department, and you're piping that information into your survey, make sure to add information into the Custom Data 1 field for your test contact.

If there is no answer, custom data, or custom variable to replace the template with, the bracketed template is simply replaced by a blank space, so your respondents will never see bracketed templates in your survey. Analyzing Your Results In the Analyze Results section, the bracketed Advanced Piping templates appear in the question and answer text just as they do as you're designing your survey. The outputs of Advanced Piping aren't recorded in the Analyze Results section. They're only evaluated on the survey page as a respondent takes the survey—to provide a more custom experience. You can filter your results by question & answer or respondent metadata, to see how respondent information relates to their responses to the rest of the questions in the survey.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/matrix-rating-scale/,Matrix/Rating Scale Question,"Matrix/Rating Scale Question Video Overview Creating a Matrix/Rating Scale Question Survey Behavior Analyzing Results Matrix/Rating Scale Question Matrix/Rating Scale Question Video Overview Creating a Matrix/Rating Scale Question Survey Behavior Analyzing Results Matrix Question A Matrix question is a closed-ended question that asks respondents to evaluate one or more row items using the same set of column choices. A Rating Scale question, commonly known as a Likert Scale, is a variation of the Matrix question where you can assign weights to each answer choice. Rating Scales automatically calculate a weighted average for each answer choice in the Analyze Results section. Video Overview Creating a Matrix/Rating Scale Question TIP! Keep column choices short, and avoid creating too many rows and columns. Large matrices may cause respondents to speed through their answers just to get past the question more quickly. To add this question type: Drag and drop Matrix/Rating Scale into your survey from the Build section of the sidebar. In the Rows fields, enter the items you want respondents to evaluate. In the Columns fields, enter the measurements you want respondents to use to evaluate the row items. Column choices should be applicable to every row item and are necessary for analysis. Configure any additional options. Click Save . Make This a Single-Row Rating Scale (Remove Row Choices) Selecting this option does three things at once: Removes the Row fields. You will only have to enter question text and Column Choices. Applies the Use Weights option so a weighted average will be calculated in the Analyze Results section. Enables the option to add Question Skip Logic to skip respondents to a future point in the survey based on their answer choice. Allow Multiple Responses per Row (Use Checkboxes) Use checkboxes to allow respondents to select more than one answer choice per row. Use Weights Assign a weight to each column, transforming the question into a Rating Scale or Likert Scale question with multiple rows. Add an N/A column : Add a column of ""N/A"" options that respondents can select if none of the other options apply to them. The answers from respondents that select the N/A option will not be factored into calculating the rating average. This option will only appear if you use weights. Forced Ranking (one response per column) Only allow respondents to select one choice per column. This asks respondents to compare the row choices to each other, similar to a Ranking question . This option will only appear if you only allow one response per row. Additional Options Under the Edit , Options , and Logic tabs, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Add an ""Other"" Answer Option for Comments Require an answer , and define a specific range or limit of rows that the respondent must answer Change the question size & layout Sort, randomize, or flip rows Add question skip logic, only if Make this a single-row rating scale is selected Add question & answer piping Learn more: Editing Questions Under the Edit , Options , and Logic tabs, you can further customize the question in the following ways: Add an ""Other"" Answer Option for Comments Require an answer , and define a specific range or limit of rows that the respondent must answer Change the question size & layout Sort, randomize, or flip rows Add question skip logic, only if Make this a single-row rating scale is selected Add question & answer piping Learn more: Editing Questions Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. Survey Behavior Depending on the respondent's screen size, large Matrix/Rating Scale questions with many columns may require respondents to scroll to the right to see all of the available column choices. Keeping Matrix/Rating Scale questions short and simple can improve completion rates. Read more about the impact of question types on mobile vs. non-mobile completion rates on our blog: How to Keep Your Survey Respondents Happy on Mobile If you require respondents to answer a specific number or range of rows, make sure you customize the error message to reflect the requirement, so respondents will know how to answer the question correctly. If you selected Forced ranking (one response per column) , respondents will only be able to apply each column choice to one row item. If a respondent tries to select the same column choice for another row, their previous selection will disappear. Analyzing Results Your results will be presented in a table with the questions or statements listed down the first column, and the answer choices listed across the first row. See example results (English only) » Average Rating If you enabled the Use Weights or Make this a single-row rating scale option when you created the question, you'll also see the average rating for each question or statement you asked respondents to evaluate. If needed, you can change the weight of each answer choice in the Design section of the survey, even after the survey has collected responses. The rating average is calculated as follows, where: w = weight of answer choice x = response count for answer choice If you chose to include an N/A column on your Rating Scale question, any N/A responses will not factor into the weighted average. Example For this example, we'll use a 5-point rating scale question. The weights assigned to each answer choices are shown in parentheses: Responsibilities are shared fairly among your team members. Strongly Disagree (1) Disagree (2) Neither Agree nor Disagree (3) Agree (4) Strongly Agree (5) After collecting responses to the survey, the results will look something like this. Strongly Disagree Disagree Neither Agree nor Disagree Agree Strongly Agree Total Average Rating Responsibilities are shared fairly among your team members. 20.45% 9 27.27% 12 20.45% 9 11.36% 5 20.45% 9 44 2.84 The average rating of 2.84 indicates that the average sentiment among respondents is that responsibilities are not shared fairly among their team members. The average rating was calculated as follows: (9*1) + (12*2) + (9*3) + (5*4) + (9*5) / 44 125/44 = 2.84 For this example, we'll use a 5-point rating scale question. The weights assigned to each answer choices are shown in parentheses: Responsibilities are shared fairly among your team members. Strongly Disagree (1) Disagree (2) Neither Agree nor Disagree (3) Agree (4) Strongly Agree (5) After collecting responses to the survey, the results will look something like this. The average rating of 2.84 indicates that the average sentiment among respondents is that responsibilities are not shared fairly among their team members. The average rating was calculated as follows: Charts The Depth display option allows you to choose between the following options: Weighted Average : Charts the average rating for each answer choice. Distribution : Charts the absolute number or percentage of respondents that selected each answer choice. The chart types available depend on the question type, and the display options you configure.

Add an Intro Page from the survey Build section in the left sidebar. Click the text in the design to edit the Page Title and Page Description . Learn more about adding and managing pages in your survey. Writing an Introduction It's a good idea to begin your survey with an introduction. Write an introduction with the assumption that respondents don't know much, if anything, about the topic of your survey. Use simple, clear language to briefly explain the topic and purpose of the survey. Your introduction only needs to be three or four sentences, or a couple of short paragraphs at most. Include the following useful information in your introduction: Your name or the name of the company or organization you represent The goal of the survey or what you're trying to find out How you'll be using the responses to make a difference If the responses are anonymous, confidential, or tracked Relevant instructions that aren't explained in the survey questions themselves Any consent statement or privacy notice required by your company or organization It's likely that some of your survey questions won't apply to all respondents taking your survey. You can use Skip Logic to guide respondents directly to relevant questions and have them skip over questions that don't apply to them, providing a better surveying experience for respondents and increasing the success of your survey project. TIP! Learn survey best practices and guidelines to help you get the insights you need to make smarter decisions at Surveys 101 (English only). Example Introductions Example 1 If you're looking to get feedback from your customers, make it clear what you're hoping to do as a result. This lets them know you recognize and appreciate the time they're taking to provide feedback. We're conducting research on the different question types SurveyMonkey has to offer. We'd love to hear from you about what question types you use the most and what question types you want to see built. This will help us make improvements to the existing tool and prioritize new features. The survey should only take 5 minutes, and your responses are completely anonymous. You can only take the survey once, but you can edit your responses until the survey is closed on May 28, 2014. Questions marked with an asterisk (*) are required. If you have any questions about the survey, please email us: youremail@email.com We really appreciate your input! Example 2 When using SurveyMonkey Audience , if you're targeting respondents who don't exactly fit your targeting needs, you can add a couple sentences to the introduction to encourage respondents to approach your survey as a hypothetical scenario. For instance, if you can't specifically target soon-to-be brides, you can ask married women to think back to the time when they were planning their wedding. We're a startup company looking to learn more about how women buy wedding dresses. Reflect back to the time if and when you were looking for a wedding dress, and try to approach this survey through those eyes.

As you add variables, the respondent percentages will split evenly across all variables. However, you can enter your own percentages if you prefer. Variable percentages must total 100%. These percentages determine the probability of a new respondent seeing that variable when they take your survey. Previewing A/B Tests Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design a few times to see what your survey will look like to respondents. You'll be shown different A/B Test variables each time you preview your survey. As people take your survey, SurveyMonkey randomly assigns each respondent to be shown a certain variable based on the percentages you define. Analyzing A/B Test Results There are several areas in the Analyze Results section where you can view and analyze the results of your A/B test. Under the Question Summaries tab, you can see the number and percentage of respondents that viewed each variable. In the CURRENT VIEW section of the left sidebar, you can Filter by A/B Test or Compare by A/B Test . Under the Individual Responses tab, you can see which variable each respondent was shown. You can filter or compare by A/B test for these question types: Multiple Choice, Checkboxes, Star Rating, Dropdown, Matrix/Rating Scale, Ranking, and Image Choice. You may notice that the distribution of respondents that saw each variable doesn't exactly match the percentages you defined. The more responses you collect, the more likely it is that your results will reflect the percentages. Since variables are randomly assigned, we do not guarantee the split will be exact, particularly for smaller numbers of participants. We suggest collecting at least 50 responses. TIP! See if there are significant differences in how respondents who saw different variables answered your survey. Exports When a Filter by A/B Test rule is applied, you can only export summary data in PDF or PPT format. However, the A/B Test questions themselves are excluded from PPT exports since there are no charts and data tables to display in the presentation. When a Compare by A/B Test rule is applied, you can only export summary data in PDF format.

Adding Logic To add Question Skip Logic: Click the Design Survey tab. Click the question to which you want to add skip logic. Click the Logic tab. For each answer option, choose the page you want to send respondents to from the Then skip to... column. You don't have to apply logic to all answer choices. (Page options described below.) Choose to send respondents to the top of the page or to a particular question on the page. If you're sending respondents to a particular question, the previous questions on that page will be hidden from them. Click Save . Test your logic! Preview the survey to test all possible logic paths before sending it out. Responses aren't recorded when previewing. Page Options Details Skip logic is triggered when people click the Next button on a survey page. A page break is necessary between the triggering question and the question people are skipped to. Question Skip Logic overrides Page Skip Logic if both are applied on the same page. If you have Advanced Branching instead, see Using Advanced Branching with Question Skip Logic to learn how these rules work together. It's important to only move respondents forward in a survey—if you send respondents backwards, it could create an endless loop and prevent them from completing the survey. When Skip Logic is applied, we automatically renumber question and page numbers, if you have numbering turned on . You should only apply logic to one question on a page since the survey can't skip respondents to two places—it will skip respondents according to the logic path of the first question on the page. We suggest placing questions with Skip Logic applied at the end of a page. This helps you remember which questions have logic applied, and keeps the experience relevant for the respondent. Create a Filter by Question and Answer to see your Skip Logic paths when analyzing results.

This allows you to disqualify respondents who don't meet your targeting criteria or consent to your terms . Adding Disqualification Logic Question Skip Logic allows you to route respondents based on their answer to a question. You can choose to send respondents who answer a question a certain way to continue through the survey, or you can disqualify respondents from the survey based on their answer and exit them from the survey. To disqualify respondents: Add a Multiple Choice question (one answer choice allowed) to your survey. Add Question Skip Logic to the answer choices that will disqualify a respondent. Choose to skip to a Disqualification Page . Choose a disqualification option in the collector options for *each* of your collectors. (See instructions in the following section.) SurveyMonkey Audience If you're buying survey responses through SurveyMonkey Audience, disqualification logic works a little differently. You'll also need to choose an incidence rate if you used disqualification logic in your survey. Learn more » Choosing a Disqualification Option When you add Skip Logic to a survey, you can choose to skip respondents to a disqualification page. To edit the disqualification option for a collector: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector and access the collector options . You may need to click Show advanced options . Click Custom Disqualification . Choose between showing respondents a custom disqualification message, sending respondents to a URL of your choice, or showing respondents the standard disqualification message (the Survey End Page setting you have enabled). You can only select one disqualification option per collector. If you have multiple answer choices in the survey that can disqualify a respondent, they'll all see the same disqualification option, no matter what question actually disqualified them. Your Custom Disqualification can have up to 500 characters. You can control the font formatting used for your Custom Disqualification message by setting the Answer choice font setting . Viewing Disqualified Respondents You can see which respondents were disqualified from the Analyze Results section of the survey. Respondents are noted as DISQUALIFIED when you view their individual response . To view only respondents who were disqualified, filter by completeness and select Disqualified responses . Example Qualifying Questions Example 1: You're looking for Netflix subscribers Let's say you want to send a survey to Netflix subscribers. To disqualify respondents who don't subscribe to Netflix: Add a Yes or No question to the beginning of the survey asking respondents if they subscribe to Netflix. Add Question Skip Logic to skip respondents who answer No (they are not Netflix subscribers) to a disqualification page. You could also choose to skip respondents who don't subscribe to Netflix to a separate page of questions asking why they don't subscribe or what sites they do use to watch movies online. Respondents who answer Yes (they are Netflix subscribers) are taken to the next page of the survey. Let's say you want to send a survey to Netflix subscribers.

Then you can see the complete results of your quota in your results. Video Overview Designing Quota Questions First, create the survey questions you want to add a quota to using only these supported question types : Multiple Choice Checkboxes Dropdown Menu We suggest adding 1–3 questions with answer choices that help you identify who you want to get responses from. Check out the Video Overview for examples. Terminology Get to know some of the terms you'll encounter when building your quota.

You can use CSAT with other metrics to understand your customers’ experience with your brand. Continue reading to learn about templates, features, and business apps that can help you build and analyze your CSAT survey in SurveyMonkey. New to measuring CSAT? Learn more about CSAT and how it works >> CSAT Overview Typical CSAT surveys include a single-choice CSAT question and a follow-up open-text question. The CSAT question looks like the example below: Overall, how would you rate your satisfaction with our company? Very Satisfied (score = 5) Somewhat Satisfied (score = 4) Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied (score = 3) Somewhat Dissatisfied (score = 2) Very Dissatisfied (score = 1) Responses to this question determine your CSAT score . Typically, responses in the top 2 categories (Very Satisfied or Somewhat Satisfied) are considered positive. You calculate your CSAT score by adding the number of responses to Very Satisfied or Somewhat Satisfied, dividing it by the total number of responses, and multiplying the result by 100. Creating CSAT Surveys There are a few ways to build a CSAT survey in SurveyMonkey. Use a template SurveyMonkey provides several free, customizable templates to help you start measuring customer satisfaction. Check out our popular CSAT survey template that you can customize for your use case. Build a survey with AI Write a prompt and let AI build a custom survey for you. Build with AI can create a survey that uses a CSAT question and other customized questions based on your company’s needs. If you’re writing a prompt for a CSAT survey: Specify any questions you want to include in your survey, like CSAT or CES. Provide information about your company and the services you provide. Describe the information you want from your customers so you can filter your results later. Don’t include sensitive information about your company or services. Start from scratch Create your survey from scratch. Add your own questions, apply question settings, apply logic, and customize the design. We recommend you use the Matrix/Rating Scale question type for your CSAT question. Check the box to Make this a single-row rating scale . This adds weights to the answer options so you can view and filter by specific scores later. if you use our Salesforce integration (available on Enterprise plans), you can also send these weights to Salesforce. General guidelines for CSAT surveys No matter how you build your CSAT survey, there are guidelines you can follow. Expand the dropdown below to learn more: Consider adding a single follow-up question that every respondent can answer, regardless of what rating users chose in your CSAT question. You can filter your responses later based on the rating people chose in your CSAT question. Think about the goal of your CSAT survey before you start writing it. This will help you decide what questions to ask so you can get the best results. Think about the people who will take your survey. Do you need to add logic to only show some questions based on how people answer other questions? Connecting to Apps Connect your CSAT data to other business apps that you use regularly to automate manual actions and send your data where you need it, Integrating Your Data with Salesforce Add-on : Available as an add-on for Enterprise plans. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Enterprise plans can use our Salesforce integration to send surveys at key touchpoints and build a single source of truth for customer insights. Use Salesforce to send a CSAT survey after a case is closed, at the end of onboarding, and more. If you use our Salesforce integration , you can send email invitations to customers after they interact with your support team. For example, you can send your CSAT survey when a support agent changes a case status to Closed. You can also build reporting in Salesforce to turn survey insights into clear and comprehensive dashboards. Collecting Responses You can send your survey using any of our collectors , as long as they’re available on your plan. Here are a few options that work well with CSAT surveys: TIP! If you’re sending a transactional survey (for example, after someone completes a purchase or calls your support team), you can use a web link collector and turn on the Multiple responses setting. This way, you don’t have to create a new web link for respondents who take your survey more than once. Analyzing CSAT Surveys Once you’ve collected responses, you can start analyzing results. Here are a few tips to help you understand your results: Understand your CSAT score To calculate your actual CSAT score, you can use our CSAT Calculator . This number is calculated as the total number of Very Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied responses divided by the total number of responses then multiplied by 100, or: (Number of satisfied customers (4 and 5) / Number of survey responses) x 100 = % of satisfied customers Example: 500 people responded to a CSAT survey. 68 were Very Satisfied (score 5), and 74 were Somewhat Satisfied (score 4). - Add the number of Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied responses to get 142. - Divide 142 by the total number of responses (500). You get 0.284 . - Multiply .284 by 100 to get 28.4%. This is your CSAT score. The equation would look like this: (142 / 500) x 100 = 28.4% If you used a single-row matrix/rating scale, you can view the average rating in your Question Summaries. However, this rating doesn’t use the same calculation as the CSAT formula above. You can use filters and compare rules to understand how people who chose a certain score responded to other questions in your survey. You can also filter by open-ended responses to identify specific keywords and phrases in your results. Use compare rules Use compare rules to view two or more answer options side by side. Compare rules can help you view responses to other questions in your survey based on the CSAT option they chose. Look at Sentiment Analysis Sentiment Analysis can help you understand the emotion behind your open-text responses. You can also filter responses by sentiment to gauge how respondents’ emotions guided their responses. Ready to build your CSAT program? Start creating your survey today!

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/accessibility/,Accessibility When Using SurveyMonkey,"Accessibility When Using SurveyMonkey 508 Compliance & WCAG2 Creating Accessible Surveys Accessible Surveys Checklist Taking Surveys with a Screen Reader Feedback Accessibility When Using SurveyMonkey Accessibility When Using SurveyMonkey 508 Compliance & WCAG2 Creating Accessible Surveys Accessible Surveys Checklist Taking Surveys with a Screen Reader Feedback SurveyMonkey understands the importance of accessibility on the web and empowers you to make surveys that are Section 508 and WCAG2 compliant. In this article, learn how you can create accessible surveys and how to use a screen reader to navigate SurveyMonkey surveys. 508 Compliance & WCAG2 If you use an accessible theme and follow the accessible survey checklist , your survey will work for people taking the survey with a screen reader. This means you can use SurveyMonkey to create accessible surveys that are compliant with Section 508 and WCAG2 standards. Section 508 Section 508 is a United States federal law that requires all electronic and information technology used by the federal government to be accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG2 WCAG2 is a set of technical guidelines for making web content more accessible. It includes a set of criteria to test for success. VPAT Documentation SurveyMonkey WCAG2 Conformance Claim [PDF]» Creating Accessible Surveys What is an accessible survey? An accessible survey is designed so that people with varying hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive abilities can complete it. An accessible survey enables survey takers using screen magnifiers to successfully complete the survey. An accessible survey has the necessary text elements to enable a survey taker to successfully navigate and complete a survey using a screen reader with a text-to-speech (TTS) system. An accessible survey can be completed using voice recognition software. An accessible survey doesn't require a mouse or keyboard to complete. Standard Themes & Color Contrast Accessible standard themes include the right amount of color contrast and brightness to ensure our survey designs are accessible to most people, including people with colorblindness. Our default survey theme, Heritage, is compliant with Section 508 standards. When designing an accessible survey, use a theme from the list below and don’t change the colors or style settings. The following standard themes are compliant with Section 508 standards: Heritage Arctic Iceberg Pastel Aqua Charcoal TIP! Look for the accessible survey icon when choosing a theme. Custom Themes To keep surveys accessible, we recommend not making changes to the standard themes that are Section 508 compliant. If you create a custom theme, use a tool like the tanaguru contrast finder to ensure that the color combinations pass WCAG standards for contrast ratio. Accessible Surveys Checklist To ensure your survey is accessible, check all of the following: ✅ Use the classic survey format The classic survey format with the Heritage theme is best for people using a screen reader to take a survey. The One Question at a Time and Conversation survey format are not fully accessible. ✅ Only use accessible question types and settings. Avoid these question types and settings: Matrix of Dropdown menus question type Click Map question type Accepting payments page Multilingual Surveys— People using a screen reader won't be able to select their preferred language from the dropdown menu Forced Ranking setting for a matrix/rating scale question type All other question types and settings are accessible. ✅ Add alt text to images and videos. To make your survey accessible to people using screen readers, Section 508 requires that a text equivalent is provided for every non-text element, like images and videos. This alternative text, known as alt text, can be in the alt attribute of the image or in the context surrounding the image, like a caption. Since screen readers can't read an image, they'll announce the alt text instead. You can add descriptive alt text to images in your survey. Click the links below to find steps to add alt text to each image type: Image choice question Freestanding survey images Image A/B Tests Logo If you add a video to your survey, provide closed captions with the video. ✅ Keep asterisks for required questions. By default, when you require a question an asterisk will appear next to the question. Don’t turn this option off. In the survey introduction, let survey takers know that asterisks mean a question is required. ✅ Change star rating icons to black. If you’re using an accessible theme and adding a star rating question change the icon color to black for good contrast. You’ll see a color dropdown when editing the question. ✅ Write clear error messages. When survey takers enter an invalid response to a question with answer validation applied , or skip a required question , an error message appears above the question. Customize the error text so that people know specifically how to answer the question so they can move on. ❌ Don't edit default navigation labels. By default, navigation buttons are labeled “Previous”,”Next”, and “Done,” which work well with screen readers. ❌ Don't include images that blink or flash. If you use animated content in your survey, check that it meets the time refresh requirements . ✅ Place text fields close to row labels. When a row label is positioned far away from the text field, it may cause issues for screen magnifiers used by low vision respondents. For Multiple Textboxes, Contact Information, or Matrix/Rating Scale questions, adjust the question layout to keep the labels and text fields close together. ✅ Use page titles for Heading 2 (H2). If you want to use an H2 in your heading rank , turn on page titles . ✅ Use the Email Invitation or Web Link collector to send your survey. Other collector types aren't accessible. ❌ Don't password protect your survey. The page to enter a password isn't accessible. Taking Surveys with a Screen Reader Screen Readers We Support JAWS NVDA VoiceOver TalkBack Most question types are compatible with screen readers (exceptions are listed in the accessible surveys checklist . For the best survey taking experience, we recommend using the most updated version of one of our supported browsers . Headings The following table describes what each heading level represents in a SurveyMonkey survey. Please refer to your preferred screen reader's manual to learn how to navigate online forms and surveys. When taking a survey, you can use your screen reader to navigate the list of questions by navigating between elements at heading level 4. If you receive error messages when submitting a page, use your screen reader to navigate heading level 4 to move between questions with error messages. SurveyMonkey surveys don't use heading levels 5 & 6. Feedback SurveyMonkey is dedicated to helping people create surveys that are accessible. If you have feedback on how we can do better, please fill out the SurveyMonkey Accessibility Feedback Form . We may not be able to respond to your feedback directly, but we'll make sure your thoughts and suggestions reach the right teams.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/carry-forward/,Carry Forward Responses,"Carry Forward Responses Carry Forward Responses Carry Forward Responses Carry Forward Carry Forward Responses allows you to funnel multiple answer choices from one question to another based on respondents' selections. You can choose to carry forward all the answers that the respondent selected, or all the answers that the respondent did not select. This feature allows you to proceed from broader questions to specific questions that are more relevant to the respondent, and more useful to your research. Video Overview Adding Carry Forward Responses Adding Carry Forward Responses requires that you add a sender question, and a receiver question on a later page. Carry Forward Responses logic is activated when the respondent clicks Next to go to the next page, so a receiver question can't be on the same page as the associated sender question. Sender Question Types The following question types can send answer choices to a receiver question on a later page in the survey: Multiple Choice Checkboxes Matrix/Rating Scale Dropdown The following question types can send answer choices to a receiver question on a later page in the survey: Multiple Choice Checkboxes Matrix/Rating Scale Dropdown Receiver Question Types The following question types can receive answer choices from a sender question on a previous page in the survey: Multiple Choice Checkboxes Matrix/Rating Scale Dropdown Ranking Multiple Textboxes It isn't possible to apply Carry Forward logic to questions within blocks using Block Randomization . The following question types can receive answer choices from a sender question on a previous page in the survey: Multiple Choice Checkboxes Matrix/Rating Scale Dropdown Ranking Multiple Textboxes It isn't possible to apply Carry Forward logic to questions within blocks using Block Randomization . To carry forward previous answer choices into a receiver question: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. Click the receiver question you want to edit. Select Use previous answer choices . Make sure you've added a sender question on a previous page (see list above). From the dropdown menu, choose the question whose answers you want to carry forward into the current question. Choose whether you'd like to carry forward responses Selected by respondent or Unselected by respondent . Click Save . The responses that are carried forward are appended after the existing answer choices. To hide an answer choice from the receiver question, click d next to the answer choice. Regardless of how a respondent answers the sender question, answer choices that you hide will not be shown to respondents. Example Here's an example of how you can use Carry Forward Responses to ask follow-up questions about choices survey-takers made: Page 1, Q1: Create a Checkboxes question to ask people which ice cream brands they have purchased. Page 2, Q2: Create a Multiple Choice question, and carry forward the answer choices that the survey-taker selected in Q1. Ask people, of the brands they answered they've previously purchased, which was their favorite. Page 2, Q3: Create a Multiple Textboxes question, and carry forward the answer choices that they did not select. Ask survey-takers to explain why they haven't purchased each brand. Here's an example of how you can use Carry Forward Responses to ask follow-up questions about choices survey-takers made: Page 1, Q1: Create a Checkboxes question to ask people which ice cream brands they have purchased. Page 2, Q2: Create a Multiple Choice question, and carry forward the answer choices that the survey-taker selected in Q1. Ask people, of the brands they answered they've previously purchased, which was their favorite. Page 2, Q3: Create a Multiple Textboxes question, and carry forward the answer choices that they did not select. Ask survey-takers to explain why they haven't purchased each brand. Live Preview When you add Carry Forward Responses logic, arrows appear in the Design Survey section, but they won't be visible to respondents taking the survey: Arrows appear next to the sender question to indicate that a question later in the survey carries its answer choices forward. In the receiver question, arrows indicate which answer choices are carried forward from a previous question. Avoid moving questions that have Carry Forward Responses logic applied. Moving questions can cause unexpected behavior. Narrow Based on Answer Column (Matrix/Rating Scale) When you carry forward responses from a Matrix/Rating Scale question, you have the additional option to narrow the choices based on column choices. For example, say the sender question asks respondents to evaluate each row choice on a scale of Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. You can narrow down which row choices are carried forward, based on the respondent's column choice. Usually, column choices represent a rating or evaluation. Here's an example of how you could configure the receiver question: If you choose Selected by respondent and Strongly Agree , only the row choices where the respondent selected ""Strongly Agree"" are carried forward. If you choose Unselected by respondent and Strongly Agree , the respondent's answer choice will only be carried forward if they leave ""Strongly Agree"" unselected. While you can narrow which row choices are carried forward based on column choice selections, you can't carry forward column choices themselves. Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to respondents. The survey will gracefully handle receiver questions that don't have any answer choices. If a receiver question has no answer choices to receive, and no answer choices of its own, it's hidden from respondents. If an empty receiver question is the only question on a page, the survey automatically skips past the empty page. Analyzing Results Carried forward responses are treated the same as other answer choices in the Analyze Results section of your survey. All answer choices that are carried forward into receiver questions are included in charts, data tables, and exports. You can also create rules based on answer choices that were carried forward.

If you're interested, contact sales . If you already have an Enterprise account, contact your Customer Success Manager. The COVID-19 Symptom Tracking and Risk Assessment survey is a tool to help your employees return to work safely. Start with a template with key questions to help make decisions about coming in to work. Based on people's answers, they'll be put into groups and you can set up a custom message to help guide their next steps. We have enabled our HIPAA security features for all SurveyMonkey accounts that have purchased the COVID-19 Symptom Tracking and Risk Assessment survey. Creating a Symptom Tracking Survey Start by setting up the survey in the Design Survey section. This is where you review the questions and add in the custom message with next steps for people to take after submitting their response. Design Your Survey Log into your SurveyMonkey account . Click Create Survey . Choose Start from a template . Choose the COVID-19 Symptom Tracking and Risk Assessment template. Once you have the basic template you can start customizing or adding new questions . You can customize existing questions by clicking Edit on the one you want to change. It's not possible to use skip logic with this template. Instead, we score questions (similar to quizzes ) and let people know next steps based on their answers. Each question in the template has point values assigned, and the total points determine the person’s score group. Each score group will see a different message at the end of the survey. The template has the points set up for each question, but you can edit the points depending on the needs of your organization. Points are assigned based on how people answer each question. For example, in the default template, people who answer Yes to ""Have you had any symptoms of COVID?"" or ""Have you had contact with anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID?"" are placed in the Stop group . People who answer No to these questions are placed in the Go group .If you don’t make any edits, these default point values will apply. Assigning points to new questions If you add new questions to the survey, they will automatically have scoring turned on. If you ask questions about additional symptoms or risk factors, add points to the answer choices so that people's answers place them in the right group. If you don't want the new questions to be counted in the results, uncheck the box that says Score this question . This will remove the option to add points to that question.

If you add or remove people from your contact list, new messages will be sent to the most up-to-date list. TIP! If you want to set up a contactless survey for one time survey takers or visitors, use the QR code Web Link collector option. Choose How to be Notified About Responses There are two ways to get notified about survey responses: Instant notifications: Get an email after every survey response. Smart notifications: Get an email when a response meets certain criteria.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/inclusive-language/,Using Inclusive Language,"Using Inclusive Language Main Considerations Gender Identity Sexual Orientation Race, Ethnicity & Nationality Using Inclusive Language Using Inclusive Language Main Considerations Gender Identity Sexual Orientation Race, Ethnicity & Nationality After you create your survey and write your questions, you should take a moment to make sure that your questions are written inclusively and with sensitivity to the experiences of marginalized individuals. We’ve offered some suggestions below on the main considerations and common pitfalls that people run into with writing inclusive language. Main Considerations Use person-centered language It’s important to value people more than the specific rules we have around language. We should always focus on the person rather than specific aspects of the person as it is dehumanizing to refer to someone using just an aspect of their identity. Ultimately, our language should be used in a way that is respectful, caring, and informed by how the individual chooses to identify. When in doubt, put the word ‘person’/’people’ before any descriptors about an individual or community. Consider the context of your language Unless it is essential to what is being communicated, you should avoid identifying people based on characteristics such as their race, skin colour, national origin, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, and religious or spiritual affiliation. Do your research Inclusive language regularly changes because of the terms that people use to self-identify change. Regularly researching the appropriate language to use when referring to marginalized peoples and communities helps in speaking about others in a way that is both respectful and inclusive. Gender Identity When creating questions based on gender, you should consider whether it is even relevant. If gender is relevant, it is ideal to use gender-neutral terms wherever possible - unless you know the pronouns of the reader. Additionally, you should never assume the gender of an individual based on their appearance. Sexual Orientation When asking questions based on sexual orientation, it is essential to be inclusive of all relationship statuses and orientations. As well, it is important to consider if someone’s sexuality is even relevant to the content. Some individuals may self-identify using terms that were or are derogatory, as a means of reclaiming the meaning behind the language. These terms can only be used to self-identify and should not be used if you aren’t a part of the community the terms have targeted. Race, Ethnicity & Nationality When asking questions about race, ethnicity & nationality, it is essential to refer to individuals and communities using the terms they prefer to be referred to as. Unless it is essential and appropriate to the context, avoid referring to people based on their race, skin colour, and/or national origin. As well, it is especially important to avoid generalizations and stereotyping people based on someone’s skin colour, cultural background, or ethnic origin.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/block-randomization/,Block Randomization,"Block Randomization Block Randomization Block Randomization Block Randomization Block Randomization allows you to group pages of your survey into blocks, and then add logic to rotate, flip, or randomize the blocks. You can also add logic to the pages within a single block. This minimizes order bias in your survey. To use Block Randomization: Go to the Design Survey section of the survey. In the left sidebar, click Logic . Click Block Randomization . Create blocks. Add logic to the blocks. TIP! Your last step should be adding logic. Add all questions and pages to the survey design before creating blocks and applying logic. Creating Blocks A block is a group of consecutive pages in your survey. You can create up to 300 blocks in your survey. To create blocks: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Click + New Block . Select the consecutive pages you want to include in the block. Some pages may be disabled if you already added logic to them that isn't compatible with Block Randomization. Click Add Block . Create more blocks, as needed. Your blocks can't be on the last page of your survey. When you're finished creating all your blocks, click Done in the bottom-left corner of the menu. Block names indicate the range of pages included in the block. For example, a block containing Page 4, Page 5, Page 6, and Page 7 of your survey would be named Block: P4-P7 . TIP! A page can only belong to one block at a time. To use the same page in multiple blocks, you can instead make a copy of the page to use in another block. Editing Blocks To edit a block: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Click Edit Blocks . Click . next to the right of the block. Click Show block details or Break block apart . Adding Logic to Blocks You can add Block Logic to control the order in which the blocks, or pages within a block, are presented to the respondent. There are two ways to apply Block Logic: You can apply both types of Block Logic to a survey. Applying Logic Within a Single Block To apply logic within a single block: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Under Add Block Logic, choose Within a single block . Click the block you want to apply logic to. Choose a Logic Type (see the table below for details). Under Pages Affected, choose to apply the logic to All pages in this block or Selected pages , where you can choose a subset of pages to apply the logic to. Click Apply . Logic Type Description No page randomization No logic is applied to the pages within the block. They are shown to respondents in order. Randomization Pages within the block are shown in a random order for each new respondent. Flip pages On average, half of respondents will see the pages within the block flipped. Example: 3, 2, 1 instead of 1, 2, 3. Rotate pages Each respondent will see a random first page, with the following pages of the block arranged in successive order based on the first. Example: The first respondent might see 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 within the block; the second respondent might see 2, 3, 4, 5, 1; and the third respondent might see 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. To apply logic within a single block: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Under Add Block Logic, choose Within a single block . Click the block you want to apply logic to. Choose a Logic Type (see the table below for details). Under Pages Affected, choose to apply the logic to All pages in this block or Selected pages , where you can choose a subset of pages to apply the logic to. Click Apply . Applying Logic Across Multiple Blocks To apply logic across multiple blocks: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Under Add Block Logic, choose Across multiple blocks . Choose a Logic Type (see the table below for details). Under Blocks Affected, choose to apply the logic to All blocks in this survey or Selected blocks , where you can choose a subset of blocks to apply the logic to. Optional: Select Limit number of blocks to display and enter a limit. Click Apply . Logic Type Description No block randomization No logic is applied across the blocks. They are shown to respondents in order. Randomize blocks Blocks are shown in a random order for each new respondent. Flip blocks On average, half of respondents will see the block order flipped. Example: 3, 2, 1 instead of 1, 2, 3. Rotate blocks Each respondent will see a random first block, with the following blocks arranged in successive order based on the first. Example: The first respondent might see 3, 4, 5, 1, 2; the second respondent might see 2, 3, 4, 5, 1; and the third respondent might see 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. To apply logic across multiple blocks: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Under Add Block Logic, choose Across multiple blocks . Choose a Logic Type (see the table below for details). Under Blocks Affected, choose to apply the logic to All blocks in this survey or Selected blocks , where you can choose a subset of blocks to apply the logic to. Optional: Select Limit number of blocks to display and enter a limit. Click Apply . Limiting the Number of Blocks to Display If you apply logic across multiple blocks, you can also select the Limit number of blocks to display setting and enter the number of blocks you want each respondent to see. This setting can help reduce survey fatigue for any given respondent by showing them a smaller subset of blocks to answer, while still allowing you to collect responses for a larger survey. The Limit number of blocks to display setting applies to all blocks in the survey, even if the Blocks Affected setting is set to only apply logic to Selected blocks . For example, if you set a limit of 2 blocks, the respondent is shown the first 2 blocks they would have seen based on the Logic Type you applied. See the example below: Total Blocks in Survey : 4 (with no extra pages not included in a block) Number of Blocks Limit : 2 Logic Type : Rotate blocks Blocks Affected : All blocks in this survey What Respondents See : Each respondent sees the first 2 blocks they would have seen based on their position in the rotation. The first respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. The second respondent sees Block 2, then Block 3, then ends the survey. The third respondent sees Block 3, then Block 4, then ends the survey. The fourth respondent sees Block 4, then Block 1, then ends the survey. The fifth respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. If you apply logic across multiple blocks, you can also select the Limit number of blocks to display setting and enter the number of blocks you want each respondent to see. This setting can help reduce survey fatigue for any given respondent by showing them a smaller subset of blocks to answer, while still allowing you to collect responses for a larger survey. The Limit number of blocks to display setting applies to all blocks in the survey, even if the Blocks Affected setting is set to only apply logic to Selected blocks . For example, if you set a limit of 2 blocks, the respondent is shown the first 2 blocks they would have seen based on the Logic Type you applied. See the example below: Total Blocks in Survey : 4 (with no extra pages not included in a block) Number of Blocks Limit : 2 Logic Type : Rotate blocks Blocks Affected : All blocks in this survey What Respondents See : Each respondent sees the first 2 blocks they would have seen based on their position in the rotation. The first respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. The second respondent sees Block 2, then Block 3, then ends the survey. The third respondent sees Block 3, then Block 4, then ends the survey. The fourth respondent sees Block 4, then Block 1, then ends the survey. The fifth respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. The first respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. The second respondent sees Block 2, then Block 3, then ends the survey. The third respondent sees Block 3, then Block 4, then ends the survey. The fourth respondent sees Block 4, then Block 1, then ends the survey. The fifth respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. Example Block Randomization is commonly used for concept testing. Let's say you're testing three different advertisements. You'll need to create three blocks of pages, one for each ad. To show each respondent all three blocks in a random order, add logic to randomize all the blocks in the survey. All respondents will see Page 1 first and Page 8 last, and they'll see the blocks in a random order. To show each respondent only one random block, first add logic to randomize all the blocks in the survey. Then, limit the number of blocks to display to 1 . Respondents will see Page 1, then one random block selected from Block 1 OR Block 2 OR Block 3, then Page 8. Using Block Randomization With Other Logic Options You can't apply Page Randomization to any pages contained within a block—that logic option will be disabled for pages within a block. Instead, you can randomize the pages within a single block in the Block Randomization feature to achieve the same result.

If you're on an Enterprise team with data stored in our Canadian Data Center, this feature isn't available. You can see if this applies to you by checking your Account Details . Add a payment page to the end of your form or survey and accept payments through Stripe . You can either assign prices to a single question, or charge a fixed price for your entire form. Connecting to Stripe Stripe is a third-party payment processor that lets you securely accept and manage payments online. You'll need to connect a Stripe account to accept payments in SurveyMonkey. Only the form owner can connect their stripe account. You can't connect a Stripe account to forms that are shared with you. To connect to Stripe: Go to My Account in SurveyMonkey. In the Linked Accounts section, find Stripe. Sign in to an existing Stripe account, or create a new Stripe account . Stripe is free and easy to set up, but if you have any issues connecting your account you can reach out to the friendly Stripe support team. Creating Your Form Adding a Payment Page Payment pages come at the end of your form. This means people need to complete your form in order to see it. For a quick payment experience, try to make a short and simple form. To add a payment page to your form: Go to the Design Survey section. On the left side of the page, open the Options menu. Select Payment . Select Stripe . Assigning Prices You can set a fixed price so all respondents are charged the same amount, assign prices to a single question in your form, or let people pay within a range. Prices must be a whole number between $1 and $10,000 in most accepted currencies . Feel free to make changes to your prices as you need—changes that you make to your form go live as soon as you edit your form design. Charging a Fixed Price Use this option if you want everyone who completes your form to pay the same amount. This is great if you're selling tickets to an event or selling a single product. To charge a fixed price: Add a payment page to your form. Select Charge a Fixed Price . Enter a Description to confirm what people are buying. Enter a Price and choose a Currency . Click Save .

Select a currency and assign a minimum and maximum payment amount. Click Save . TIP! If you have a limited amount of tickets or items that you want to accept payment for, you can add a quota to your form. Once the quota has been met, respondetns won't see the payment page. Currency Options People taking your form have plenty of options to pay—Stripe supports over 135 currencies and accepts major credit cards. Form Responses & Payment Transactions Collecting Responses After you design your form, create a collector to send it out and start accepting payments. Web Links are the easiest way to get started, and Email Invitations are great if you have an email list to send your form to. You can send a form with a payment page using any collector type —except for Audience, Mobile SDK, Facebook Messenger and Kiosk Survey. After a respondent submits a payment, they won't be able to return to the form even when Response Editing is on. Viewing Transactions When someone submits a payment through your form, Stripe collects all of the details from the payment page, which means SurveyMonkey never saves or stores any credit card numbers. You can go to the Analyze Results section of your form to see a limited record of your transactions. You'll find them at the very bottom of your form results. The transaction record shows: Stripe's transaction ID number The amount paid The date and time The item description The respondent's first and last name The transaction status This is only a snapshot of each payment taken at the time the form is completed. To view real-time purchase totals, make refunds, and transfer funds to your bank account, log in to Stripe . Turning Off Payments You can stop accepting payments at any time by deleting the payment page from your form or by closing your form . Deleting a payment page from your form will also delete any transaction records from previous payments in the Analyze Results section. You'll always be able to see your complete transaction record in your Stripe account. If you disconnect your Stripe account in My Account , you won't be able to collect any additional payments from forms with a payment page. Making a Payment When someone submits a payment through your form, they'll receive an email from Stripe confirming their transaction. Transactions appear on their credit or debit card statements with the name of your form. SurveyMonkey's platform allows you to integrate with third-party payment processors. Some of these payment processors may require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) under the EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2) . People in Europe who submit payment through your form may need to provide additional authentication. It's not possible to disable this authentication when payment processors require it. If someone runs into issues making payment, they can reach out to Stripe or their card issuer for help.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/question-page-randomization/,Question & Page Randomization,"Question & Page Randomization Video Overview Question Randomization Page Randomization Question & Page Randomization Question & Page Randomization Video Overview Question Randomization Page Randomization Using randomization can help reduce order bias and improve the quality of your data. One way to do that in SurveyMonkey is by using Question or Page Randomization to change the order in which people taking your survey see the questions. Video Overview Question Randomization Question Randomization lets you change the order of any questions on a page in your survey. You can apply it to a specific set of questions, or all questions on the page. Adding Question Randomization To turn on Question Randomization: Go to the Design Survey section. Click Logic . Click Question Randomization . From the Select Page menu to choose the correct survey page and click Next . For Format , Choose from the following options: Randomize questions: questions will appear in a random order for each person taking your survey. Flip questions: on average, half of the people taking your survey will see the question order flipped. For example, 3, 2, 1 or of 1, 2, 3. Randomize questions: questions will appear in a random order for each person taking your survey. Flip questions: on average, half of the people taking your survey will see the question order flipped. For example, 3, 2, 1 or of 1, 2, 3. For Questions Affected , apply to All questions on page or only Selected questions . Click Apply to save. (Optional) Repeat the steps to apply Question Randomization to other survey pages. TIP! Use answer randomization to flip, sort, or randomize choices for an individual question. Removing Question Randomization To turn off Question Randomization: Go to the Design Survey section. Click Logic . Click Question Randomization . From the Select Page menu, choose the page you added randomization to. For Format , select No Randomization . Click Apply to save. (Optional) Repeat the steps to remove Question Randomization from other survey pages. If you have Skip Logic or Question & Answer Piping applied to your survey, using Question Randomization may lead to unexpected behavior. Page Randomization Page Randomization lets you rotate, flip, or randomize pages in your survey—all pages or a specific set of pages. Adding Page Randomization: To turn on Page Randomization: Go to the Design Survey section. Click Logic . Click Page Randomization . For Format choose from the following options: Randomize pages : pages will appear in a random order for each new person taking your survey. Flip pages : on average, half of the people taking your survey will see the page order flipped. For example, 3, 2, 1 or 1, 2, 3. Rotate pages : the page order depends on what the previous person saw—the first page they saw is the last page the next person will see. For example,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, then 3, 4, 5, 1, 2. Randomize pages : pages will appear in a random order for each new person taking your survey.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/page-skip-logic/,Page Skip Logic,"Page Skip Logic Video Overview Adding Logic Page Options Details Troubleshooting Page Skip Logic Page Skip Logic Video Overview Adding Logic Page Options Details Troubleshooting Question and Page Skip Logic You can apply Page Skip Logic to a page so that everyone that reaches the page is skipped to a specific destination later in the survey—like a later page or the end of the survey. Unlike Question Skip Logic , Page Skip Logic doesn't depend on respondents' answers to specific questions—it's simply activated when a respondent reaches that page, and clicks Next. If you have the Advanced Branching feature instead, it replaces Page Skip Logic, so you'll need to use Advanced Branching instead to achieve the same effect. Video Overview Adding Logic To add Page Logic: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. At the top of the survey page, click the Page Logic button. Select Page skip logic from the menu. If you don't see this option, you may have Advanced Branching instead, which replaces Page Skip Logic. If you don't see this option, you may have Advanced Branching instead, which replaces Page Skip Logic. Choose one of the page options (described below). To remove Page Skip Logic, follow the above steps to open the Page Skip Logic tab. Then click Clear from the right of the blue bar. Test your logic! Preview the survey to test all possible logic paths before sending it out. Responses aren't recorded when previewing. Page Options You can choose one of the following pages to send respondents to: Any page number - This will skip respondents to the designated page. You must move respondents forward through the survey, and not backward. End of Survey - This will send respondents directly to the end of the survey, which will activate the Survey End Page you specified in the collector options. Their response will be considered COMPLETE when you view their individual response in the Analyze Results section. Disqualify Respondent - This will send respondents to a disqualification page. You can customize the disqualification page in the Collector Options. Their response will be considered DISQUALIFIED when you view their individual response in the Analyze Results section. Details Skip Logic takes effect when a respondent clicks the Next button to advance through the survey. Question Skip Logic overrides Page Skip Logic if both are applied on the same page. It's important to only move respondents forward in a survey—if you send respondents backwards, it could create an endless loop and prevent them from completing the survey. When Skip Logic is applied, we automatically renumber question and page numbers, if you have numbering turned on . Troubleshooting Read more about troubleshooting Skip Logic issues .

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/advanced-branching/,Advanced Branching,"Advanced Branching Video Overview Survey Requirements Adding Advanced Branching Using Multiple Rules Conditions & Actions Managing Existing Rules Previewing & Testing Rules Analyzing Your Results Common Questions Advanced Branching Advanced Branching Video Overview Survey Requirements Adding Advanced Branching Using Multiple Rules Conditions & Actions Managing Existing Rules Previewing & Testing Rules Analyzing Your Results Common Questions PAID FEATURE: Advanced branching is only available on some paid plans—see what's on your plan . Advanced Branching lets you customize the behavior of your survey based on multiple conditions and it's one of our most powerful logic features . Build conditions based on a respondent's answers, custom data from Contacts , custom variables , or survey language. When the criteria you define in your conditions are met, you can skip respondents to future points in your survey, show or hide questions, show or hide pages, or invalidate questions and customize the error message. Add unconditional skip logic to a page, so that everyone that reaches that page is skipped to a specific page later in the survey. For example, you can have respondents select only the products they’ve purchased from a list of options and then show them follow up questions relevant to those products while hiding the follow up questions on products they didn’t purchase. Or, you can disqualify respondents who answer a series of questions in a certain way, so you can screen out respondents that aren't relevant to your survey's goals. TIP! It's best to apply Advanced Branching after your survey design is finalized. Video Overview Survey Requirements Before adding Advanced Branching to your survey, it's helpful to understand what data you can base conditions on, and what collector types you'll need to use in order for everything to work smoothly. Adding Advanced Branching To add Advanced Branching to your survey: In the Design Survey section, go to the page you want to add logic to. Click Page Logic at the top of the page. Choose Advanced branching logic . Click + NEW RULE . Define the conditions and actions for this rule. You can add more rules after you save this one. Click Save Rule . Click Apply . TIP! If you add more than one rule, review the Using Multiple Rules section below for more information. Using Multiple Rules Types of Rules The Advanced Branching Logic tab is split into two sections where you can set up the three different types of rules. Section Rule Type Description Advanced branching rules Advanced Branching Rule A rule composed of a condition and an action. Advanced branching rules Conditional Skip Rule A rule composed of a condition and a branching action, specifically. Find a full list of actions in the Conditions & Actions section. If no other skip rules apply, proceed to this page... Unconditional Skip Rule An unconditional rule composed of an action only. The Advanced Branching Logic tab is split into two sections where you can set up the three different types of rules. Order of Rules and Conflicts When a respondent submits a page in your survey, all the rules on that page are evaluated in order from top to bottom. If you use multiple types of rules together, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Unconditional Skip Rule If two or more rules of the same type conflict with one another, we take action on the first rule in the list, and ignore any subsequent rules that conflict with it. When a respondent submits a page in your survey, all the rules on that page are evaluated in order from top to bottom. If you use multiple types of rules together, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Unconditional Skip Rule If two or more rules of the same type conflict with one another, we take action on the first rule in the list, and ignore any subsequent rules that conflict with it. Using Advanced Branching with Question Skip Logic While you can use Question Skip Logic and Advanced Branching on the same survey, we suggest using Advanced Branching exclusively so you can manage all of your logic in one place and better avoid conflicts. If you do use Advanced Branching and Question Skip Logic together, and there's a conflict between the two types of logic, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Question Skip Logic > Unconditional Skip Rule. For example, if you have an Advanced Branching Rule and Question Skip Logic based on the exact same condition, the Advanced Branching Rule takes precedence. While you can use Question Skip Logic and Advanced Branching on the same survey, we suggest using Advanced Branching exclusively so you can manage all of your logic in one place and better avoid conflicts. If you do use Advanced Branching and Question Skip Logic together, and there's a conflict between the two types of logic, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Question Skip Logic > Unconditional Skip Rule. For example, if you have an Advanced Branching Rule and Question Skip Logic based on the exact same condition, the Advanced Branching Rule takes precedence. Conditions & Actions Creating rules is as easy as creating logical sentences based on questions in your survey, or information about your respondent. Every rule is made up of two parts: a condition and an action. You can build rules based on the following subjects. Keep in mind that some subjects will only work when you use a certain collector type to send your survey. Conditions Conditions define the fields you want to base the rule on, and how you want us to evaluate those fields. Conditions are made up of three parts: Part Description Example Subject The data you want to base the rule on. Q4: What is your age? Operator Tells us how to evaluate the subject's value to make the condition true. You can use several different operators to define the relationship between the subject and the value. is one of Value The value of the subject you're basing the rule on. This could be the answer choice the respondent selected, the open-ended response they type into your survey, or the data that we know about them already from Contacts , Custom Variables , or survey language. 17 or younger 18-20 21-29 Adding Multiple Conditions to a Rule You can add multiple conditions to a rule and use the Boolean operators OR or AND to define the relationship between the conditions. Within a single advanced branching rule, you can either use all AND operators, or all OR operators—you can't mix and match. The NOT Boolean operator is not available. Conditions define the fields you want to base the rule on, and how you want us to evaluate those fields.

Within a single advanced branching rule, you can either use all AND operators, or all OR operators—you can't mix and match. The NOT Boolean operator is not available. Actions Actions define what the survey should do if the conditions are met. There are two types of actions: Branching Actions and Other Actions . Branching Actions let you skip respondents to a later point in the survey when the conditions of your rule are met. Other Actions let you show or hide questions and pages, or invalidate questions when certain conditions are met. Rule Type Action Description Branching Action Skip to page Skip the respondent to a future page in your survey. Branching Action Exit block Skip the respondent to the next available block, if Block Randomization applied. If a block is not available, the respondent will skip to the next available page. Branching Action End survey Skip the respondent to the Survey End Page option. The response is marked as COMPLETE when you view their individual response Branching Action Disqualify respondent Skip the respondent to the disqualification page that you select in the collector options. The response is marked as DISQUALIFIED when you view their individual response . Other Actions Hide question Hide a question on a future page in the survey. Questions are shown until the conditions are met. Other Actions Show question Show a question on a future page in the survey. Questions are hidden until the conditions are met. Other Actions Hide page Hide a future page in the survey. Other Actions Show page Show a future page in the survey. Other Actions Invalidate question Invalidate any question on a future page, or the current page, and customize the error message that respondents will see when they try to proceed to the next page of the survey. Actions define what the survey should do if the conditions are met. There are two types of actions: Branching Actions and Other Actions . Branching Actions let you skip respondents to a later point in the survey when the conditions of your rule are met. Other Actions let you show or hide questions and pages, or invalidate questions when certain conditions are met. Managing Existing Rules To view or edit an existing rule: Click the advanced branching icon « at the top of a page to view or edit the rules applied to that page. Click the down arrow to the right of any rule to edit, copy, delete, or move a rule. You can't copy or move rules to another page in the survey. TIP! When you save a rule, we convert it into a script. To understand what an existing rule means, you can hover over the script to see what each piece represents. Previewing & Testing Rules The best way to test Advanced Branching depends on the subjects you based your rules on. At this time there's no way to reference advanced branching rules alongside your survey as you test it. Testing Rules Based on Questions If all of the conditions in your survey are based on questions and their responses, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on which answer choices you select. If all of the conditions in your survey are based on questions and their responses, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on which answer choices you select. Testing Rules Based on Custom Data from Contacts If any of your conditions are based on custom data from Contacts , the best way to test your survey is to create a group in your Contacts and then send an Email Invitation to that group. When you create a test group, include email addresses that you have access to for testing. When you add custom data to those contacts, make sure that you have a test contact for each persona you based your advanced branching rules on. For example, if you use the Custom 1 field to record each contact's department, and you based advanced branching rules on multiple departments, make sure to create a test contact that represents each department. When you compose your invitation message, insert custom data tags into the message so you can refer to the set of custom data you're about to test when you receive the email. After you're done testing, clear and delete the collector to remove the test data from your survey. If any of your conditions are based on custom data from Contacts , the best way to test your survey is to create a group in your Contacts and then send an Email Invitation to that group.

After you're done testing, clear and delete the collector to remove the test data from your survey. Testing Rules Based on Custom Variables If any of your conditions are based on custom variables , the best way to test your survey is to create a Web Link and edit the variables in the URL to test different logic paths. Allow multiple responses so you can test the survey several times with different variables. If any of your conditions are based on custom variables , the best way to test your survey is to create a Web Link and edit the variables in the URL to test different logic paths. Allow multiple responses so you can test the survey several times with different variables. Testing Rules Based on Survey Language If all of the conditions in your survey are based on the survey language, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on survey language. If all of the conditions in your survey are based on the survey language, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on survey language. Analyzing Your Results Your results in the Analyze Results section will look the same as any normal survey. If a respondent was skipped past a question or page due to a branching action, or if a question was hidden from a respondent, the questions they didn't see are marked as skipped in the Analyze Results section. There's no way to view or export the logic path that a particular respondent took through your survey. Common Questions Can I show or hide questions dynamically on the same page? No. We evaluate the advanced branching rules on a page when a respondent submits that page, so you can only show or hide questions on future pages. No. We evaluate the advanced branching rules on a page when a respondent submits that page, so you can only show or hide questions on future pages. Will my rules update if I delete or add more questions and pages? If you delete pages, questions, or answer choices in your survey, advanced branching rules update automatically so you don't need to go back to update them manually. For example, if one of your rules is based on Q1, and then you add a new question before it that becomes the new Q1, the rule will dynamically update to reference Q2 instead. However, we recommend waiting to apply advanced branching rules until after your survey design is complete. It's easier to apply logic once the organization of your survey is finalized.

Are values case sensitive? Yes, values are case sensitive. Yes, values are case sensitive. What's the difference between Advanced Branching and Question Skip Logic? While Question Skip Logic can only take one action based on one condition (the answer to one closed-ended question), advanced branching logic allows you to take multiple actions based on multiple conditions—including conditions based on open-ended fields. While Question Skip Logic can only take one action based on one condition (the answer to one closed-ended question), advanced branching logic allows you to take multiple actions based on multiple conditions—including conditions based on open-ended fields.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/quizzes/,Quizzes,"Quizzes Creating a Quiz Assigning Points Showing People Their Score Analyzing Quiz Results Exports and Shared Data Quizzes Quizzes Creating a Quiz Assigning Points Showing People Their Score Analyzing Quiz Results Exports and Shared Data Turn any survey into a quiz by adding quiz questions! When people answer a quiz question, you can tell them whether they got the answer right, or keep their scores to yourself. When you analyze your results, you'll get overall score statistics, and individual scores for each person that took the quiz. Creating a Quiz Add a Quiz Question You can make any survey into a quiz by adding at least one quiz question to your survey. TIP! When you create a new survey from scratch and choose the Quiz category, any new Multiple Choice, Checkbox, Image Choice, or Dropdown questions you add will have scoring turned on by default. To add a quiz question: Create a Multiple Choice , Checkbox , Image Choice , or Dropdown question and add the question text and answer choices you need. All other question types aren’t compatible with Quizzes. Select Score this question (enable quiz mode) —this makes it into a quiz question with scoring. Define which answers are correct by clicking the empty checkmark icon to the left of an answer choice. The checkmark icon fills in to indicate that it's the correct answer. You can choose more than one correct answer. Adjust the point value of any correct answer choice by clicking the up and down arrows next to the point value. Click Save . If your survey has quiz questions, avoid using logic, as it's not compatible with Display Quiz Results . Quiz scores are calculated using the total points in the survey. With skip logic, some people might skip over some questions in the survey which can result in their scores being lower because they didn’t answer all quiz questions. Scoring Checkbox Questions If your Checkbox or Image Choice quiz question uses checkboxes to allow more than one answer, you should require people to select a specific number of answer choices . Otherwise, since points aren't deducted for incorrect answers, even if someone selects a wrong answer in addition to the correct ones, they'd still get the full points for the question—which might lead to a confusing final score. For example, if there are two correct answers to the question, you should require that respondents select exactly 2 choices. TIP! In the question text, make sure to tell people how many answer choices they should select.

For example, if there are two correct answers to the question, you should require that respondents select exactly 2 choices. TIP! In the question text, make sure to tell people how many answer choices they should select. Add Custom Feedback to a Quiz Question Quizzes Pro You can display different feedback to people based on whether their answer is correct, incorrect, or partially correct on the Quiz Results Page . For example, if someone gets a question right, you can tell them “Good job, friend.” If they get it wrong, you can say ""Better luck next time"" or tell them the right answer. To add custom feedback to a quiz question: Click a quiz question to edit it. Click the Options tab. Click Add Custom Feedback to Question . Enter feedback for each outcome. Assigning Points You can assign points to answer choices when quiz mode is enabled for a question. The typical point value for a correct answer is 1, but you can assign more than 1 point to any answer choice. It’s not possible to assign negative points to an answer choice. The points people earn for each question are added up into a total score when they finish the quiz. It's not possible to view or group scores by page or section. TIP! It's possible to adjust points assigned to quiz questions even after responses are collected. Any changes to point values will be reflected in the existing scores on the Analyze page . Max Score When you're editing a quiz question, you can see the maximum number of points someone can earn for that question. For Dropdown or Multiple Choice questions (where only one answer is allowed), the max score is equal to the highest point value assigned to an answer choice in the question. For Multiple Choice questions using checkboxes (where respondents can choose more than one answer), the max score is equal to total point value across all answer choices (regardless of whether you require a limit or range of answer choices). When someone gets the max score for a question, the question is considered correct in the question summary and in their individual response in the results. Partial Credit You can set up your quiz so that people can get partial credit for choosing certain answers. For example, you can assign 2 points to the best answer, and 1 point to the answer choice you want to give partial credit for. If the respondent gets partial credit (not the max score possible for the question), their individual response will show that they got the question ""partially correct"". Showing People Their Score Show Quiz Results at the End of the Quiz You can choose whether you want to show someone their total quiz score, and a summary of how they did on each individual quiz question, when they finish the quiz. The quiz results page only includes quiz questions—questions without scoring aren't included. Unlike Instant Results , the quiz results page only shows the respondent's own score.

To add an N/A column to a Matrix/Rating Scale or Ranking question: Click the Design Survey tab. Click a Matrix/Rating Scale or Ranking question to edit it. Or, add a new one. Below the answer choice fields, select Add a N/A column . NOTE: If you are using a Matrix/Rating Scale question, this option will not appear until you select the Use Weights option. The N/A answer choice field will appear among the rest of the choices. If you want the label to say something other than ""N/A"", you can enter a new label (optional). Click Save . Matrix/Rating Scale When you add an N/A column to a Matrix/Rating Scale question (with the Use Weights option applied), an N/A column without a weight associated with it will be added to the column choices. If a rating item does not apply to a respondent, an N/A column will give the respondent an opportunity to essentially opt out of the question, instead of choosing an inaccurate answer. Ranking When you add an N/A option to a Ranking question, it will add an N/A checkbox at the end of each row. If a respondent selects an N/A checkbox, that row will be greyed out and will not be included in that respondent's ranking order. Respondents answer a Ranking question by dragging and dropping their answers in order of preference, so you want to make sure that even the lowest ranked options still apply to that respondent. If a respondent doesn't have the option to declare that a ranking item does not apply to them, they will be forced to include that choice in their rankings anyway, which might produce bad data. Adding an N/A Option to Other Question Types You can also add an N/A option as an additional answer choice to other question types, like Multiple Choice, but the system will not automatically remove those choices from analysis. To learn more about the pros and cons of the N/A answer choice, take a look at our blog post here: The N/A Answer Choice: When It’s Good To Use & When It’s Not (English only).

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/question-answer-piping/,Question & Answer Piping,"Question & Answer Piping Video Overview How Question & Answer Piping Works Adding Piping Survey Behavior Analyzing Your Results Question & Answer Piping Question & Answer Piping Video Overview How Question & Answer Piping Works Adding Piping Survey Behavior Analyzing Your Results Question and Answer Piping Question & Answer Piping allows you to insert, or ""pipe,"" answer text from a previous question into a question on a later page in the survey. Video Overview How Question & Answer Piping Works Question & Answer Piping is related to Advanced Piping , which is a more advanced version of the feature that lets you insert custom variables and custom data from Contacts into your survey in addition to answer text from a previous question. For example, here's how you might set up a survey using Question & Answer Piping: Page 1, Q1: Single Textbox In what city do you currently live? Page 2, Q2: Matrix/Rating Scale How satisfied are you with the following aspects of {{ Q1 }}? Public Transportation Safety Education Housing Costs If the survey taker enters ""New York"" for Q1, ""New York"" would replace {{ Q1 }} in the follow-up question. For that specific survey taker, Q2 would then read ""How satisfied are you with the following aspects of New York?"" Adding Piping Adding piping requires that you add a sender question, and one or more receiver questions on a later page. A sender question is a question whose answer you want to insert into a later receiver question in the survey. You can pipe the same answer from a sender question up to 4 times in the survey. Piping is activated when a survey taker clicks Next to go to the next page, so a receiver question can't be on the same page as the associated sender question. Only apply piping after the design is complete. Piping will not dynamically update if you add questions in an order that changes the original question numbers. Sender Question Types You can pipe answer text from the following question types: Multiple Choice Dropdown Image Choice (only captions) Comment Box Single Textbox Slider You can pipe answer text from the following question types: Multiple Choice Dropdown Image Choice (only captions) Comment Box Single Textbox Slider Receiver Question Types You can pipe answer text into the following question types: Multiple Choice Dropdown Net Promoter Score Matrix/Rating Scale Single Textbox Multiple Textboxes Ranking Comment Box Date/Time Text Text A/B Test Image A/B Test You can also pipe answer text into the following question types, with a few exceptions: Matrix of Dropdown Menus: You can pipe text into row labels and column labels, but not answer choices (the text that appears in the dropdown menus). You can also pipe answer text into ""Other"" answer option labels. You can pipe answer text into the following question types: Multiple Choice Dropdown Net Promoter Score Matrix/Rating Scale Single Textbox Multiple Textboxes Ranking Comment Box Date/Time Text Text A/B Test Image A/B Test You can also pipe answer text into the following question types, with a few exceptions: Matrix of Dropdown Menus: You can pipe text into row labels and column labels, but not answer choices (the text that appears in the dropdown menus). You can also pipe answer text into ""Other"" answer option labels. To pipe answer text into a following question: In the Design Survey section, click the receiver question—the question you want to customize with piped text. This must be a question on a page that comes after the sender question. Click the question text or answer choice field into which you want to pipe a previous answer, and leave your cursor in the position where you want to insert the piped text. Click Insert text from... . If there are sender questions that you can pipe from, they will appear in a menu. Choose the sender question you want to pipe from. This will insert the absolute question number within curly brackets. For example: {{ Q2 }}. When people take the survey, the bracketed template will be replaced by the respondent's answer to the sender question. Piping Error Question and Answer Piping isn't supported when Page Randomization is applied to either the page that contains the sender question, or the page that contains the receiver question. If you receive an error that prevents you from saving a question with piping, remove the Page Randomization on those pages, or remove the piping from the question. Piping may not work when applied to an 'Other' answer choice that has been carried forward . Survey Behavior Before you send out your survey, preview your survey design to see what your survey will look like to survey takers. If a survey taker skips the sender question, the bracketed template won't show in the receiver questions—it's replaced by a blank space. You may want to make the sender question required to avoid incomplete sentences or blank spaces. Analyzing Your Results In the Analyze Results section, piped answers appear as bracketed templates, the same way they do in the Design Survey section. For example, 'How satisfied are you with the following aspects of {{ Q1 }}?' Survey takers will see the piped text when they’re taking the survey for a more personalized experience. You can filter your results by question and answer to see how piped answers relate to the rest of a survey taker's responses.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/troubleshooting-skip-logic/,Troubleshooting Skip Logic Issues,"Troubleshooting Skip Logic Issues Troubleshooting Skip Logic Issues Troubleshooting Skip Logic Issues Question and Page Skip Logic Review these common issues that arise when using Skip Logic. Respondents get stuck on one page and can't advance If a respondent reports that they can't advance past a specific question or page in the survey, it is likely that the Skip Logic on that page is configured to route the respondents to that same page if they select a certain answer choice. When a respondent selects that answer choice and clicks Next , they are sent back to the same page and can't move forward. Go to Design section of your survey to review the logic pattern of the survey. Start with the question or page that respondents are getting stuck on, and make sure that your logic is configured to move them forward in the survey. If a respondent reports that they can't advance past a specific question or page in the survey, it is likely that the Skip Logic on that page is configured to route the respondents to that same page if they select a certain answer choice.

Go to Design section of your survey to review the logic pattern of the survey. Start with the question or page that respondents are getting stuck on, and make sure that your logic is configured to move them forward in the survey. Respondents skipped required questions If Skip Logic has been applied to the design, then your logic is most likely skipping respondents over sections or pages containing required questions. Check the survey to confirm what questions/pages have logic and which page it is jumping respondents over. Begin in the Analyze section by selecting to view all pages. (That option is located in the upper left side of the Response Summary page, to the right of the left sidebar.) Any respondent that has been jumped according to the logic will have blank pages. If the respondent was never directed to that page, then that respondent was never able to answer those questions. Pages further along in the design will have their answers on the questions if the respondent was directed to them. If instead a person just exited early, the rest of his/her response will be blank when viewing the survey.

We suggest adding question text instructing respondents to omit the percent sign (%) from their responses. Running Total Respondents will not see a running total update dynamically as they enter their answers, but if they enter a set of numbers that do not add up to the required fixed sum, they will receive an error message when they try to move to the next page of the survey, indicating that the choices must add up to a specific number.

To show the Previous button, turn on Response Editing—allow respondents to go back to previous pages in the survey and update existing responses. TIP! If you buy survey responses using SurveyMonkey Audience , we remove the Previous button from the survey, so it's not possible for respondents to go back to previous pages to edit their responses . Browser Navigation Buttons Respondents should not use browser navigation buttons to move through the survey. If a respondent clicks their web browser's Back button instead of the survey's Previous button, they can't change or save their responses on the previous page. Respondents may see a cached version of the previous page that won't accept new responses, or they may be prompted with a form resubmission error. Translations If you change the survey language , the default navigation button text will automatically change to match that language. Legacy Navigation Buttons The Exit link option is no longer available. This change shouldn’t impact your surveys, data, or the respondent’s experience when exiting a survey page. Respondents can exit surveys anytime by closing their browser tab or window. No matter how someone exits a survey page, the survey behavior is the same. Survey responses entered on the current survey page aren’t saved when the survey is exited. However, responses on previous pages remain saved.

To add one, you only need a basic understanding of HTML and access to your website’s source code. We’ll give you an embed code you can copy and paste. You can embed a survey on multiple pages of your site, if you want. Website Collector Types Modal Windows Popup Invitations and Popup Surveys show in modal windows that float above your webpage. Modal windows don't require your site visitors to load a new page, and they aren't affected by popup blockers. Cookies We use cookies to stop popups or embedded surveys from reshowing if someone already answered, declined, or closed the survey. If someone clears their cookies, visits your site using a browser that blocks or disables cookies, or the website is opened in a new browser session, the collector can’t remember whether they’ve taken the survey or declined it, so the popup may appear again allowing additional responses. Closing Your Survey When you close your survey , it continues to display on your website, unless you remove the embed code from your site. Creating a Website Collector To create a Website collector: Go to the Collect Response section of your survey. Choose Embed on a site . If you already have a collector for your survey, select Website collector . Choose a website collector type . Scroll down to edit the the style and behavior settings, and adjust the collector options. View the preview to know what your survey will look like on your website. Click Copy Code to copy and paste the embed code onto a page in your site. When embedding a survey or button , paste the script into your HTML wherever you want the survey to appear on your page. When showing a Popup invitation or Popup survey , paste the script into your HTML immediately before your closing </body> tag. When embedding a survey or button , paste the script into your HTML wherever you want the survey to appear on your page. When showing a Popup invitation or Popup survey , paste the script into your HTML immediately before your closing </body> tag. The code only needs to be added once. You don’t need to update the Embed code if you make changes to your survey or collector—your updates will display as soon as you refresh the page. Style and Behavior Settings The live survey preview updates as you customize your style and behavior settings for your survey. Settings vary by website type . Collector Options Update the collector options , which are called Settings on the Embedded button type, to customize the survey experience. Some collector options are limited on certain website collector types: Embedded surveys don't have a Survey end page option. Instant results aren't available on any website collector type. The Custom thank you includes SurveyMonkey branding at the end of an Embedded survey, even if you chose to Hide SurveyMonkey Branding . Embed Tips Please don’t edit the Embed code! The Embed code contains several lines of JavaScript and a unique ID that's tied to both your collector and your survey. You can paste the embed code on a single or multiple pages by pasting the embed code before the </body> tag. If you want all pages of your site to display the survey, button, or invitation, paste the embed code before the </header> tag.

TIP! Follow these steps to set up your Email Invitation Collector before sending your survey so you can track respondents. Opened & Clicked Through Rates By tracking the opened and clicked through rates of your email invitations, you can identify where respondents need help and send more effective follow-up emails. Opened Rate Opened Rate = # Opened / # Total Invitations Your Opened rate is the percentage of recipients who opened the email invitation in their email client. The opened rate helps you measure which subject lines or email delivery times entice people to open the email invitation. To improve your opened rate: Send reminder messages . Write compelling subject lines. Schedule invitations when people are more likely to take surveys . Opened includes both recipients who only opened the invitation AND recipients who opened the invitation and clicked through to the survey. To find the number of people who opened the email invitation but did not click through, simply subtract the number of clicked through from the number of Opened.

Clicked Through Rate Clicked Through Rate = # Clicked Through / # Total Invitations Your clicked through rate is the percentage of recipients who clicked through to the survey by clicking the Begin Survey button (or clicked the survey link). The clicked through rate helps you measure which email content inspires action—in this case, getting your recipients to click the Begin Survey button. To improve your clicked through rate: Make sure your content is easy to understand and concise. Provide a compelling reason to take the survey—explain what the survey's about, how long it will take, and how you'll act on the results. Clicked Through Rate = # Clicked Through / # Total Invitations Your clicked through rate is the percentage of recipients who clicked through to the survey by clicking the Begin Survey button (or clicked the survey link).

Invitation Tracking Setting Invitation Tracking Track how many people opened your invitation and clicked through to your survey in the Overview tab of the collector. You need to keep Invitation Tracking turned on—it's turned on in the collector options by default. Invitation Tracking has two settings: On, show how many people opened your email invitation and clicked through to your survey Off, don’t show how many people opened your email invitation and clicked through to your survey You can't edit this setting once you schedule or send your first invitation in the collector. If you turned off Invitation Tracking, you're not able to turn it back on . Opened and clicked through data will still be collected in the backend, but you won't be able to see it in your collector. See Information about Page Tags in our Privacy Notice for more info. Invitations Chart Opened & Clicked-Through Rates The Invitations chart tracks how recipients interact with your email invitations. This chart includes useful data like how many recipients opened the email invitation and how many recipients clicked through to your survey. The minimum number of recipients who opened the email invitation in their email client—more people may have opened the email invitation because: Open data can't be tracked if recipients don't download images in their email client. Opened data can't be tracked for messages you send as plain text . Recipients you send plain text messages to are counted as Unopened unless they click through. If they click through, they are counted as both Opened and Clicked through. Responses Chart The Responses chart tracks how recipients interact with your survey. This chart includes useful data like how many people responded to the survey, how many people completed the survey, and how many people only partially completed the survey. TIP! You can calculate your survey response rate by dividing the number of Total Invitations by the number of Total Responses. In general, you can expect a low response rate if your survey is long, your survey language is complicated, or you send your survey to the wrong audience. Read our tips to ensure you're doing all you can to get the best response rate possible . Common Questions How do I view individual recipients or responses?

Use the drop-down menus to filter by: All Recipients All Responded Complete Responses Partial Responses Not Responded Opted Out Bounced It's not possible to filter by Opened, Clicked Through, or Unopened. You can also view individual responses from the Analyze Results section of your survey. Under the Individual Responses tab, you'll see the email address and response status tied to each individual response. What if a recipient opts out? Recipients can opt out from your email invitations at any time. The number of Opted Out recipients appears below the Invitations chart, separate from the total number of invitations you sent. This is because: Recipients who opt out may have opened the email invitation or clicked through before opting out. Recipients who opt out may have responded to your survey before opting out. Recipients may have previously opted out from your email invitations. Example Status A recipient opens the email invitation and immediately clicks the opts out link. • Opted Out • Opened • Not Responded A recipient opens the email invitation, clicks the Begin Survey button, and completes the survey. Then the recipient clicks the opt out link. • Opted Out • Opened • Clicked Through • Complete A recipient clicks the opt out link from a previous message you sent in a different collector. Then you add them to a new message and send the message. • Opted Out • Unopened* • Not Responded * We don't send messages to email addresses that have previously opted out, but we still include them in your Total Invitations as Unopened and in the Recipients tab as Not Responded.

What if I send a single recipient multiple messages? The Invitations and Responses charts only count each recipient once. No matter how many messages you send to an individual recipient through the collector, they're only counted once in the charts. Example Status You send a recipient an Invitation message, but they don't open it. Then you send them a Reminder message and they do open it. • Opened You send a recipient an Invitation message, but they don't open it. Then you send them a Reminder message and they open it and click the Begin Survey button. • Opened • Clicked Through You send a recipient an Invitation message, but they don't open it.

Each collector type works a little differently, so they all have different sets of options to choose from when you set them up. Collector options are survey settings that enable you to customize the survey-taking experience for your respondents. These settings affect who can access your survey, how many times respondents can take the survey, and what respondents see when they're done. Accessing Collector Options To access your collector options, go to the Collect Responses section of your survey and click the name of the collector. TIP! Collector options are collector-specific, not survey-wide. If you have multiple collectors, you need to customize the settings for each one separately. Complete List of Collector Options The collector options available depend on the collector type you're using. If you don't see a particular option in the collector type you're using, it means it isn't available for that collector type. Learn more in the articles linked below, and be sure to check out the help article about the collector type you're using. Additionally, some collector options aren't available on all SurveyMonkey plans . If a particular feature isn't available on your plan, you'll see the option to upgrade when trying to use the feature.

Learn more about sending a recurring email invitation . How It Works Setting up a recurrence makes it easier to regularly share the same survey and gather data over time. This collector option saves you time by automatically creating new Web Links , called Occurrences, at a frequency you choose. What's cool about this setting is that you can easily filter your results by each occurrence to see how people responded differently over time. 1. Design your survey 2. Create a Web Link Collector 3. Turn on Recurrence in your collector options 4. Get email notifications when each new Web Link is ready to share with respondents 5. Share the new link Scheduling a Recurrence To create a recurrence: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Add a Web Link collector. From the Collector Options, click Recurrence and select On . Select the frequency that the recurrence repeats —daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Choose all other recurrence details, like when the recurrence repeats, how it's determined, and when it ends. (Optional) Edit the Reminder Email Address . Review your Recurrence Summary and click Continue . Click Save on the confirmation window to re-direct to My Recurrences. Once on My Recurrences , you can set up the rest of your collector options in the Template , or grab the link to your survey in the Occurrence. Tracking Respondents Web Link Collectors track IP addresses, but this information can't really help you track respondents . If you want to be able to match each response with the person who submitted it, add required questions to your survey to collect identifying information from respondents. What does ""Repeat By"" do? When you set up a monthly or quarterly recurrence, the Repeat By setting defines when in the month or quarter you want to receive your new web link. For example: To get a new web link on the 15th of every month, choose Day of the Month. In the Start Date field, pick the 15th on the calendar. To get a new web link on the 2nd Wednesday of every month, choose Day of the Week. In the Start Date field, pick the 2nd Wednesday on the Start Date calendar.

To get a new web link on the 2nd Wednesday of every month, choose Day of the Week. In the Start Date field, pick the 2nd Wednesday on the Start Date calendar. Getting Your New Web Links Getting My New Web Link You can copy your new web link from the reminder email, or from the collector in your account. Each new web link is called an Occurrence. Each Occurrence name includes a number so it's easy to tell them apart. To get your new web link: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of your Recurring collector. Collectors with a Recurrence are marked with this icon in your collector list: From My Recurrences , click on the Occurrence you want to access. Copy the URL. Share the link. Reminder Email We'll send a reminder email each time a new web link is created. The email is sent to the address entered in the Reminder Email field during setup. By default, the owner email address is pre-populated in that field, but it can be changed. We recommend sending reminder emails to the person responsible for sharing the survey link. The reminder email can only be sent to 1 person and you can't customize the content of the email. Editing Your Recurrence Editing a Recurrence Any edits you make to the Recurrence Template affect future Occurrences only. To edit your Recurrence: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the recurring collector you want to edit. Collectors with a Recurrence are marked with this icon in your collector list: Click on the Template nickname to open it.

Required data tags are placeholders that are automatically replaced with the following content when the message is sent. When the Embed first question option is selected, [FirstQuestion] inserts the first question of your survey in your email invitation message. [FirstQuestion] is only required if Embed first question is selected and replaces the requirement to include [SurveyLink]. Inserting Required Data Tags We include all required data tags in the draft messages provided for Plain Text or Custom HTML messages, but if you copy and paste your own custom text, you'll see an alert if you're missing a required data tag. To insert a required data tag: Open the message editor. Place your cursor in the message where you'd like to insert the tag. At the top of the message field, click Insert Required Data . Select the tag to insert. TIP! The HTML Template message format automatically includes required tags for you as part of the template design, so you don't need to manually insert them. Editing Links with Custom HTML If you're using the Custom HTML message format, use [SurveyLink] and [OptOutLink] as the URL within the anchor tag. The survey link and opt out will automatically replace the bracketed values once you send the message. For example: <a href=""[SurveyLink]"">Take the survey!</a> <a href=""[OptOutLink]"">Please remove me from your mailing list.</a> While you can edit the text surrounding the opt out link to better customize your invitation message, per our Acceptable Uses Policy you must clearly explain what the opt out link does, and you should not attempt to hide the link in the message.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/suspended-mailing-privileges/,Suspended Mailing Privileges,"Suspended Mailing Privileges Suspended Mailing Privileges Suspended Mailing Privileges We monitor outgoing messages from Email Invitations to ensure we meet industry standards for bounce rates and spam or abuse rates. To help keep your bounce and abuse rates low, read our Acceptable Uses Policy so you understand what is and is not permitted. Messages Pending Approval Occasionally, a message you try to send may be flagged for review and marked as Pending Approval . After reviewing, we'll release messages that comply with our Acceptable Uses Policy , or we'll contact you to notify you of any issues. Messages may be marked for review for a few reasons: The message was auto-flagged as spam by our system. Most people don't realize that emails they send can be considered as spam by email clients or by recipients, so we created some great guidelines for avoiding spam filters . The opt out link was not clearly labeled or was hidden in the message. Cleaning Your Email List If you exceed bounce rates or abuse rates, we may suspend your mailing privileges within SurveyMonkey. You will need to clean your email lists in order to reactivate your mailing privileges. It's your responsibility to clean your email lists outside of SurveyMonkey before using them on the site. It's not permitted to use SurveyMonkey as a method of cleaning your email lists. Bounced Emails : We monitor hard bounces. A hard bounce is an email message that was returned to the sender and is permanently undeliverable. This may be due to an invalid email address or a mail server blocking the SurveyMonkey domain. You can view bounced recipients at any time within an Email Invitation. Abuse Complaints : Email providers send us the number of recipients who manually mark your email invitations sent via SurveyMonkey as spam. The percentage of your messages that were marked as spam contribute to your abuse rate. This percentage does not include bounces or people who opt-out via the remove link inside the message. You cannot track abuse rates within SurveyMonkey. TIP! If you need to send a survey right away, create a Web Link and distribute the survey through your own email client.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/printing-responses/,Can respondents print their responses?,"Can respondents print their responses? Printing Proof of Completion Can respondents print their responses? Can respondents print their responses? Printing Proof of Completion Exports No, respondents can't print a record of their answers after they complete a survey. However, if you allow respondents to edit responses , they can go back to review or change their responses. As the survey creator, you can export and print a PDF of an individual response in the Analyze Results section. Depending on your situation, you might consider creating a form instead of a survey to collect the data you need. Forms are useful for collecting information and keeping a record for both the form creator and the respondent themselves—whereas a survey is best for collecting feedback and making decisions based on aggregated results. For example, think of an order form—customers want to keep a record of what they ordered, and the company needs to keep a record of the response to follow through with the delivery. With Wufoo , an online form builder, you can set up confirmation emails so that respondents automatically receive an email with all their answers, and any custom message you'd like to include along with that. Printing Proof of Completion There's no way to automatically generate a certificate of completion for respondents, but there are two alternatives: Send your survey via Email Invitation to track respondents and their response status, so you can know who completed your survey. Host a certificate of completion on your own website (or an image-hosting site), and edit the Survey End Page option to redirect respondents to that URL after they complete your survey.

Web Link Confirmation Emails Turn on Web link Confirmation Emails To turn on Confirmation emails for Web links: Go to the Collect Responses section and choose the Web link option. From the list of Collector options, find Send copy of responses and select On, let respondents request a copy of their answers via email.

Name the group (the email addresses will be stored in your Contacts ). Decide what you'd like to do if someone already exists in your Contacts . You can either update contact information associated with the email address with the info in your current import, or ignore import information so the info you already have for that contact stays as is. Click Add . Read the section below if you see any errors . Please be sure to use individual email addresses and not a Listserv, distribution list, or email alias (since only one person from the list would be able to take the survey). Copy & Paste Email Addresses You can type in or copy and paste a list of email addresses directly in the Send To field. Just pop them in and hit enter. Recipient & Message Limits There is a limit to how many people you can send to, as well as how many messages you can send in one day: Sending, Import & Character Limits Import Methods Manual List (Simple Copy and Paste) You can copy and paste a simple list of email addresses using the Manual import option.

Example : bob@email.com jane@email.com marge@email.com pat@email.com You can copy and paste a simple list of email addresses using the Manual import option. Guidelines : Each email address should be on its own line. Example : bob@email.com jane@email.com marge@email.com pat@email.com Manual List (Advanced Copy and Paste) You can copy and paste a list of email addresses, names, and custom data using the Manual import option. If you're using a city and state (like Portland, Oregon) this will create two fields: one for Portland, one for Oregon. If the commas are too confusing, you can simply copy and paste the rows of your spreadsheet into the box! Guidelines : Each email address needs to be on its own line with custom data fields separated by commas. If you don't have info for a given field, leave a blank space. You must put the email address first: Email, First Name, Last Name, Custom 1, Custom 2, etc. Example : Here's an example list with email, first name, last name, 3 custom fields (age, gender, and favorite ice cream flavor). We don't have Jane's age, we don't have Pat's age or gender, and we don't know Marge's favorite ice cream flavor, so we'll leave those blank: bob@email.com, Bob, Thompson, 39, male, chocolate jane@email.com, Jane, Smith, , female, strawberry marge@email.com, Marge, Simpson, 33, female, pat@email.com, Pat, Lyon, , , pistachio You can copy and paste a list of email addresses, names, and custom data using the Manual import option.

Email Import You can use Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, LinkedIn, Microsoft 365, or Outlook.com to import all your contacts. If you make changes to contacts in your email account, they're not reflected in SurveyMonkey (your SurveyMonkey account is not synced to those applications). To add only some contacts or to import contacts from another email provider or site, go to your email account and export the contacts you want as a CSV file, then import the file to SurveyMonkey. For instructions on how to export your contacts to a CSV, please search your email provider's help center. Outlook.com, the free web-based email service formerly known as Hotmail.com, differs from the Microsoft Office Outlook mail application. To import contacts from Microsoft Office Outlook, first export your contacts into a CSV file, and then import the file. Or ask your IT department if your Outlook application is powered by Microsoft 365. You can use Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, LinkedIn, Microsoft 365, or Outlook.com to import all your contacts.

Invalid Email Errors If you see an error about invalid emails or that “something went wrong” when you try to send or schedule a message, it means you may have: Added duplicate email addresses Included contacts that are opted out or bounced Imported a contact list that wasn’t formatted correctly Duplicate Emails You can send one invitation email per email address per collector, by default. When you Invite More and add a contact that was already sent an invitation from the collector, we automatically remove them from your contact list before sending your new message. Enterprise customers may be able to Allow duplicate invites when they choose to Invite More. Anyone can create a new Email Invitation collector for the survey if you want someone to take a survey more than once. If you want to send someone your invitation message again, you can send them a one-off reminder. Opted Out or Bounced Emails You can’t send messages to people who have opted out or bounced. Ask them to opt back in if they want to take your survey. Then, create a new email invitation collector to send them the survey (the old collector will continue to list them as opted out or bounced). You can check for opted out or bounced emails in the Recipients tab under the Sent column. Spreadsheet and Contact Errors If you imported or added a contact list that wasn’t formatted correctly, you won’t be able to send your message. Here are some tips to fix the errors, then try to add contacts again. While there's a hard limit of 10,000 rows per spreadsheet, it may be helpful to break large lists down into multiple CSV files. We suggest files with fewer than 2,500 rows each and import them one at a time. Or copy and paste the rows of the spreadsheet using the Manual import option. Delete the header row from your spreadsheet. Any formatting of the header row can cause errors. Make sure you're using an accepted delimiter for the spreadsheet (colon, semicolon, pipe, comma, or tab), and that your character encoding is in Unicode ( UTF-8 or UTF-16). If your spreadsheet includes Asian characters, make sure your character encoding is set to UTF-8 format. If you're using a Mac, try saving your file as MS-DOS Comma Separated (.csv). Go to File > Save As > Format. Review our import, sending, and character limits for more info on special characters and vanity domains. If you're copying and pasting a list of emails using the Manual import option, make sure the email address is listed first, then you can add other info. Check out the example above. Editing Contacts Draft or Scheduled Emails You can remove contacts from draft or scheduled emails. From the Overview tab, click Resume and expand your contact group in your email invitation. Reminders & Thank Yous When you're sending a Reminder or Thank You message, you don't upload contacts from scratch. Instead, you can choose from the people you've already invited. Click Edit Recipients in any Reminder or Thank You message to remove recipients. You can remove up to 1,000 recipients. Update Email Address or Custom Data To update someone's data in the Recipients tab: Click your username in the upper-right corner to go to your Contacts . Find the email address, click the contact to make edits, and save. Go back to your Email Invitation collector. In the Recipients tab, you should see the new info. Any new messages you send will use the up-to-date info you saved in your Contacts. Export the data from the Recipients tab to use when analyzing your results. Contact details are pulled into survey results when a recipient submits their response, so they aren't updated when you make edits in Contacts. Sent Messages You can delete a recipient from a sent Email Invitation. One reason you may need to do this is if a recipient requests their Right to Erasure . In this case, the account holder needs to delete all the recipient's personal and response data. To delete a recipient from the collector: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Open the Email Invitation collector used to send your survey. Click on the Recipients tab. Click recipient's email address. Click Remove recipient record . This removes the recipient from the Email Invitation collector. When you receive a Right to Erasure request, we also recommend that you: Delete the individual's response Delete the recipient's contact You can delete a recipient from a sent Email Invitation.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/embedding-questions/,Embedding Questions in Email Invitations,"Embedding Questions in Email Invitations How to Embed In-email Response Capture Collector Option Survey Behavior Supported Question Types Survey Design Requirements Troubleshooting Issues Embedding Questions in Email Invitations Embedding Questions in Email Invitations How to Embed In-email Response Capture Collector Option Survey Behavior Supported Question Types Survey Design Requirements Troubleshooting Issues You can embed the first question of your survey in your Email Invitation , as long as the first question is a supported question type. When a survey taker chooses an answer option in the email, they're sent to the first page of your survey to continue taking the survey. TIP! If you don't see the Embed first question toggle when you're composing your message then you're not using a supported question type or your survey doesn't meet the design requirements . How to Embed To embed a question in an email: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. Add a supported question type to the very beginning of page 1. Make sure your survey meets the design requirements . Don't enable any option that would disqualify the question or you won't see the option to embed the first question. Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Create an Email Invitation . Compose your message and make sure the Embed first question toggle is on. (Optional) Customize your message . Click Next . Select the In-email Response Capture collector optio n and other collector options. In-email Response Capture Collector Option You can choose whether to save the first response from the email instantly or to wait to save the response until the respondent clicks the Next or Done button. By default, the collector option is set to Off and saves the first response upon clicking Next or Done. If the embedded question has an Other Textbox or Comment field , recipient’s responses won’t be recorded from the email instantly—the response is only submitted when clicking the Next or Done button in the browser. Password Protection isn't available when In-email Response Capture is On. To use Password protection, turn off In-email Response Capture. When In-email response capture is On, email scanner bots could click the links within your email invitation, as a security measure. These bot clicks record responses to the embedded question before your respondent sees the email. This means bots can cause misleading responses for the embedded question (including, a sole bot response, multiple responses, or varying NPS responses). When an actual respondent takes the survey, the responses recorded by email scanner bots are replaced by the respondent’s true answer. If you’re concerned about poor response quality due to email scanner bots, don’t enable In-email response capture. If you’ve already collected data with this option on, you can clean up your responses in Analyze by identifying and deleting incomplete responses related to the collector that were recorded shortly after sending the invitation. Bot answers will only have recorded responses to the embedded, first question. Survey Behavior How the first answer choice is saved is dependent on the In-email Response Capture collector option selection and whether the embedded question has an Other Textbox or Comment field. Regardless of whether the first answer is saved immediately or not, the survey taker is sent to the first page of the survey so they can continue answering the rest of the questions. They'll see their response to the first question pre-selected in SurveyMonkey. Survey takers need to click Next on the first page to save their other responses and trigger any logic in your survey. If you're sending a test email to preview the survey, we don't pre-populate the response in the survey preview since we don't actually collect any responses in survey previews . When the first question is embedded, the email invitation doesn't have a Begin Survey button. Survey takers need to answer the embedded question to open the survey in a browser tab to take remaining survey questions. Supported Question Types To embed a question in an email invitation, use a supported question type as the first question on page 1 of your survey: Multiple Choice Net Promoter® Score (NPS) Star Rating Survey Design Requirements To embed a question in an email invitation, your survey needs to meet these survey design requirements: Use a supported question type as the first question on page 1 of your survey—don't add anything in front of the question, like an Intro Page or Text. Don't use Page Randomization or Block Randomization on page 1 of your survey. Don't enable a Quota on your survey. Setting and Option Requirements The settings and options applied to the question you want to embed may disqualify it or cause it to render differently in the email than what you see in your survey design. Multiple Choice Questions Don't insert an image or video in answer choices. If you enable the Randomize, Flip, or Sort Choices option on the question, don't randomize or flip answer choices, but you can alphabetize them. Don't enable the Adjust Question Layout option. Don't enable the Question Text A/B Test option. We don't recommend adding an “Other” answer option or comment field on the question you want to embed—the question will render differently in the email. While the full Other answer option or comment field will display once the survey opens in a browser, survey-takers may not notice the additional answer option. If you changed the layout of the question to 2 columns, 3 columns, or horizontal, it'll be displayed as 1 column in the email. Don't insert an image or video in answer choices. If you enable the Randomize, Flip, or Sort Choices option on the question, don't randomize or flip answer choices, but you can alphabetize them. Don't enable the Adjust Question Layout option. Don't enable the Question Text A/B Test option. We don't recommend adding an “Other” answer option or comment field on the question you want to embed—the question will render differently in the email. While the full Other answer option or comment field will display once the survey opens in a browser, survey-takers may not notice the additional answer option. If you changed the layout of the question to 2 columns, 3 columns, or horizontal, it'll be displayed as 1 column in the email. Star Rating Questions You can use the Star, Smiley, or Heart icons on the question you want to embed, but, due to email client compatibility, you can't use the Thumb icon. Don't add Other as an answer option for comments. Don't enable the Question Text A/B Test option. Don't use image or video rating labels . You can choose a scale from 2 to 10, however, questions with larger scales aren't mobile responsive—they'll be static in the email, so people will have to scroll to see the full scale. You can use the Star, Smiley, or Heart icons on the question you want to embed, but, due to email client compatibility, you can't use the Thumb icon. Don't add Other as an answer option for comments.

Troubleshooting Issues Why does the email look different than what I see in SurveyMonkey? If you update your survey design after scheduling your message and it no longer meets the requirements, we'll send the default email template without the embedded question. Email clients can render HTML messages differently , which can cause HTML Template or Custom HTML messages to display differently than what you expect.

You may receive one or a couple responses over the maximum because any respondent in the process of taking the survey when the maximum is reached is still able to submit it. For example, let's say the maximum is set as 100 and you already have 99 responses recorded. If two people access the survey simultaneously, the first person to finish is the 100th respondent. The other respondent will still be able to complete the survey, which means the survey will collect a total of 101 responses. If you're using both Response Limits and a Cutoff Date and Time , whichever comes first will close the collector.

SurveyMonkey records respondent IP addresses in backend logs and deletes them after 13 months. Tips for Anonymous Surveys If you’re using multiple collectors, you need to turn on Anonymous Responses in each collector. If you want your survey to be anonymous, don’t include identifiable questions in your survey design and don’t use identifiable custom data or custom variables when sending your survey. If you have an Enterprise plan , Primary Admins can choose a default Anonymous Responses setting for their entire team. If you need your survey responses to be anonymous, turn on the Anonymous Responses setting before you send your survey. While you can edit anonymous responses after sending the survey, it’s not possible to make existing responses anonymous. Changing the setting only applies to new responses. Web Links Web Links record the IP addresses of respondents by default. To turn on Anonymous Responses: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector. Click Anonymous Responses and choose On . Email Invitations Email Invitations are designed to help you track respondents, so your survey results will include the email address and IP address of each respondent by default. Additionally, the first name, last name, and custom data about your contacts is tracked, if you included this information in the collector. To turn on Anonymous Responses: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the collector. Go to the collector options . If you've already sent an invitation, go to the Options tab. When sending your first invitation message in the collector, you'll choose collector options after composing your message. Click Anonymous Responses . Choose to exclude all respondent information to exclude first name, last name, email address, IP address, and custom data from your results. Or choose only exclude personal information to exclude first name, last name, email address, and IP address from your results. TIP! Even if Anonymous Responses is turned on, you can still track email invitations . This info is tied to the email invitation, not to survey results. Other Collector Types By default, most collectors record the IP addresses of respondents in survey results. You can turn on Anonymous Responses to prevent IP tracking. To turn on Anonymous Responses: Go to the collector options for your collector Turn on Make Anonymous or turn off Save IP Address in Results? Respondent Authentication When Respondent Authentication is turned on, the survey is never anonymous because the survey taker’s SSO profile information is tracked. Collectors Created by Integrations Some integrations automatically create collectors in SurveyMonkey, like the Microsoft Teams integration . Whether a survey is anonymous or not is dependent on the integration's settings rather than the Anonymous Responses collector option.

However, email clients can display HTML messages differently, which could cause some variation in your HTML Template or Custom HTML messages, especially in older email clients.

If your message is flagged by our system or by your survey takers, we may suspend your mailing privileges and contact you for additional information. How to Avoid Spam Filters Our Acceptable Uses Policy describes SurveyMonkey’s email requirements and restrictions. Also, we recommend you follow these guidelines: Only send surveys to people who have agreed to receive emails from you. If you purchased an email list, contact all recipients through your own email client to get their consent before messaging them through SurveyMonkey. Use your personal email address or work email address in the From field so survey takers know who is sending the message. Better yet, use a Custom Sender Name and Email Domain . Make sure to include how to opt out or unsubscribe from your survey invitations. Write a descriptive subject line. Rather than using the default subject, share the topic of the survey or your company name so people know what the email contains. Provide an introduction in your message. For example, let people know who you are, how you obtained their email, or the goal of your survey. Use proper grammar and punctuation in subject lines and messages. Some things to avoid are: Writing in all caps Words like free, win, or money Symbols like exclamation points (!), percent (%), or money ($) Referencing incentives or prizes in your subject Writing in all caps Words like free, win, or money Symbols like exclamation points (!), percent (%), or money ($) Referencing incentives or prizes in your subject Spam filters are customizable and can block emails containing specific words.

If you see an error about invalid contacts or that “something went wrong” when you add recipients or try to send a text message, it means your list wasn't formatted correctly or you added duplicate, opted out, or bounced phone numbers. TIP! View an image of an example CSV to see correct formatting. Email Import You can use Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, LinkedIn, Office 365, or Outlook.com to import all your contacts. If you make changes to contacts in your email account, they're not reflected in SurveyMonkey. Your SurveyMonkey account is not synced to those applications. To add only some contacts or to import contacts from another email provider or site, go to your email account and export the contacts you want as a CSV file, then import the file to SurveyMonkey. Outlook.com, the free web-based email service formerly known as Hotmail.com, differs from the Microsoft Office Outlook mail application. To import contacts from Microsoft Office Outlook, first export your contacts into a CSV file, and then import the file. Or ask your IT department if your Outlook application is powered by Office 365.

Survey Example You want to see if men are significantly more satisfied with your product than women. Add two multiple-choice questions to your survey: • What is your gender? (Male, Female) • How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with our product? (Satisfied, Dissatisfied) Make sure at least 30 respondents select male as their gender AND at least 30 respondents select female as their gender. Add a Compare Rule to the question ""What is your gender?"" and select both the male and female answer options as your groups. Use the data table below the question chart for ""How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with our product?"" to see if any answer options show a statistically significant difference. What is a statistically significant difference? A statistically significant difference tells you whether one group's answers are substantially different from another group's answers by using statistical testing. Statistical significance means that the numbers are reliably different, greatly aiding your data analysis. Still, you should also consider whether the results are important — it's up to you to decide how to interpret or take action on your results. For example, say you receive more customer complaints from women than you do from men. How do you know this is a real difference you should address? One great way is to run a survey to see if your male customers are a lot more satisfied with your product. Using a statistical formula, our statistical significance feature can help you determine if men have significantly higher levels of satisfaction with your product than women. This allows you to take action on data, not on anecdote. Statistically Significant Difference If your results are highlighted in your data table, that means that the two groups are significantly different from one another. Significance means that the numbers are statistically different — it doesn't mean the finding is important or meaningful. If your results are highlighted in your data table, that means that the two groups are significantly different from one another. Significance means that the numbers are statistically different — it doesn't mean the finding is important or meaningful. No Statistically Significant Difference If your results are not highlighted in your data table, even though the percentages being compared may be different, the two numbers are not statistically different. Responses with no statistically significant difference show that the two items being compared are not significantly different at your sample size, but does not necessarily mean that they are unimportant. You may be able to detect a statistically significant difference by increasing your sample size. If your results are not highlighted in your data table, even though the percentages being compared may be different, the two numbers are not statistically different. Responses with no statistically significant difference show that the two items being compared are not significantly different at your sample size, but does not necessarily mean that they are unimportant. You may be able to detect a statistically significant difference by increasing your sample size. Sample Size If you have a very small sample size, only large differences between two groups will be significant. If you have a very large sample size, both small and large differences will be detected as significant. However, if two numbers are statistically different, it doesn't mean that the results are meaningfully different. You'll have to decide which differences are meaningful to your survey goal. If you have a very small sample size, only large differences between two groups will be significant. If you have a very large sample size, both small and large differences will be detected as significant. However, if two numbers are statistically different, it doesn't mean that the results are meaningfully different. You'll have to decide which differences are meaningful to your survey goal. Calculating Statistical Significance We calculate statistical significance using a standard 95% confidence level. When we display an answer option as statistically significant, it means the difference between two groups has less than a 5% probability of occurring by chance or sampling error alone, which is often displayed as p < 0.05. To calculate the statistical significance between groups, we use the following formulas: *1.96 is a number used for the 95% confidence level since 95% of the area under a student's t-distribution function lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Example Calculation Continuing the example from above, let's find out if the percent of men who say they are satisfied with your product is significantly more than the percent of women. Let's say you surveyed 1000 men and 1000 women and found 70% of men say they are satisfied with your product compared to 65% of women. Is 70% significantly higher than 65%? Use the following survey data to complete the formulas: p1 (% of men who are satisfied with the product) = 0.7 p2 (% of women who are satisfied with the product) = 0.65 n1 (# of men you surveyed) = 1000 n2 (# of women you surveyed) = 1000 Since the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than 1.96, it means the difference between men and women is significant. Men are more likely to be satisfied with your product than women. Hiding Statistical Significance To hide statistical significance for all questions: Click the down arrow to the right of the compare rule in the left sidebar. Click Edit rule . Click the toggle next to Show statistical significance to turn them off. Click Apply . To hide statistical significance for one question: Click Customize above the question chart. Click the Display Options tab. Uncheck the box next to Statistical significance . Click Save . The swap rows and columns display option is automatically turned on when you show statistical significance. If you uncheck this display option, statistical significance is turned off as well.

See example exports » To export your survey results: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select Save As at the top of the page. Select Export files . Select an export type: All Summary Data or All Responses Data . Choose XLS , select your export options, then select Export . To download your file, select Exports from the toolbar, then select the export. Exports are stored in the Exports for 14 days. Summary Data Summary Data exports organize survey results by question. Depending on question type , the XLS export includes presentation-ready tables with: The text of the question and answer options The response count, percentage per answer choice if it was a drop down or multiple choice question, and a corresponding chart The number of respondents who answered and the number who skipped the question Make sure to select include open-ended responses when exporting to see answers from Comment Boxes, Textboxes, or questions where Other was an answer option or comment field. Responses Data Responses Data exports organize survey results in a spreadsheet where each row contains the answers from a given respondent. The question type determines how the data is reported in the spreadsheet. Condensed Columns vs. Expanded Columns This setting only affects questions with a single answer choice allowed. By default, spreadsheet columns are condensed . This means instead of listing each answer option in separate columns, only the answer the respondent chose is listed in the cell—all responses are listed in one column. If you choose to expand columns, every possible answer choice for a given question is listed in its own column. If a respondent chose a particular answer option, it's written in the cell under the appropriate column. If a respondent did not choose a particular answer option, the cell under that column is blank. Actual Answer Text vs. Numerical Value By default, if a respondent chose a particular answer option, your actual answer text is used in the cell. You can choose to have your answer choices converted to numerical values . The values assigned to your answer choices correspond to the order in which they appear in your survey design. 1 is assigned to the first answer choice in the list, 2 is assigned to the second answer choice in the list, and so on. If you added Other as an answer choice, it's assigned 0. For Rating questions, we use the weighted value assigned in the survey design as the numerical value for each answer option. You'll need to build your own key to see which answer choice belongs to which assigned number. For imported SurveyMonkey Audience demographic info, the weights assigned correspond to the order of the answer options in your data tables. Spreadsheet Organization Each row in the spreadsheet contains the answer set from a given respondent, allowing you to do your own analysis per question. TIP! Still need help with the spreadsheet?

Consider what insights you want to get before building your surveys. Make sure to include question types that will help you get the information you need. Use the same or similar questions across surveys you want to compare. You can get the best insights from surveys that collect the same data points from different audiences. Consider using benchmarkable questions or questions from the Question Bank. These questions follow a standard format and that makes it easy to compare results in the same chart. Create a Multi-Survey Analysis Dashboard To create a multi-survey dashboard: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select Multi-survey analysis (Beta) . If you have a dashboard for this survey, you'll see a list of dashboards that include the survey. If you haven't created a dashboard with this survey yet, you'll find a new dashboard for your survey. Review the charts for your survey. To add more surveys to your dashboard, select Add surveys . Add Surveys to a Multi-Survey Dashboard You can add surveys to your multi-survey analysis dashboard at any time. To add surveys: Open your dashboard. Select Add surveys , then choose the surveys to include in your dashboard. Select Save And Close . How to Choose Surveys for a Multi-Survey Dashboard Here are some tips to help you build a useful multi-survey analysis dashboard. Compare rating questions that use similar value ranges. If the ranges are too different, the results may be hard to visualize in a chart. For example, a rating question on a scale from 0-100 may not fit well in a chart with a question on a scale from 1-5. It’s easier to compare results from surveys that use questions from the Question Bank. These questions follow a standard format and that makes it easy to compare results in the same chart. You can compare large surveys that show the same questions to different people based on logic. For example, say you have an employee feedback survey that segments respondents by department using logic. You can compare the results from those questions in the same dashboard and tiles. Manage Your Dashboard Once you create your dashboard, you can make a few changes. You can: Edit the title or description Change the survey selection Duplicate the dashboard Delete the dashboard Edit dashboard title or description To edit the dashboard title , click the title, then enter new text.

View Individual Responses in the Response Explorer You can review the responses for all questions included in your dashboard. To review responses, expand the tray on the right side of your dashboard. Select a response to view all of the answers the respondent left on your survey. Use Tiles to Analyze Data Tiles are the building blocks of your dashboard. You can create and customize charts using tiles, and rearrange them to compare, contrast, and combine your data. There are several tile types you can use: Tips for Using the Any Tile Here are some tips to get great visualizations using the Any tile. Include questions with similar value scales . For example, don’t compare a slider question on a scale from 1-100 with a slider question on a scale from 1-5. Include questions that collect the same types of data . For example, Matrix and Multiple Choice questions can work together well, but Ranking and Multiple Choice might not. Add a Tile The visualization options for each chart depend on the chart you choose and the data in your responses. You may not be able to select all visualization options for each tile. To add a tile to your dashboard: From your dashboard, select Add New Tile . (optional) Enter a title and description for your tile at the top of the page. Choose the tile type you want to add. TIP! If you can’t remember the question type you wanted, or you want to choose from all of your survey's questions, choose the Any tile. Select Continue To Data . Choose which questions to include in the tile. The table shows all questions that can be included in the tile. You can also search for a specific survey name or question. After choosing the questions to include, select Continue To Visualization . Choose the visualization you want to use. Then, set the Display options for the visualization you chose. The available display options may change for each tile type and visualization. Select Create Tile to add it to your dashboard. Repeat these steps to add more tiles to your dashboard. Manage Tiles You can edit the title and description, change the visualization, and change the questions in your tile at any time. You can also delete a tile to permanently remove it from your dashboard. To edit a tile : Select the three dots on the top right of the tile. Choose an option: To edit the title or description, select Edit title or description . After saving your changes, you may need to refresh your dashboard to see the new tile name. To change the questions included in the tile, select Edit data . To change the chart type or display options, select Edit visualization . To edit the title or description, select Edit title or description . After saving your changes, you may need to refresh your dashboard to see the new tile name. To change the questions included in the tile, select Edit data . To change the chart type or display options, select Edit visualization . To delete a tile : Select the three dots on the top right of the tile. Select Delete tile . At the confirmation message, select Yes, Delete . The tile is removed from your dashboard. You can’t change a tile’s type after adding it to your dashboard. To change the tile type, delete the tile and create a new one. Rearrange Tiles Rearrange your tiles to compare, contrast, and combine your data. You can put the most important visualizations at the top of your dashboard, or even put related tiles next to each other. To rearrange tiles , drag a tile to a new spot on your dashboard. You can place tiles above, below, or next to other tiles. You can place up to 2 tiles next to each other. TIP! Place 2 tiles that visualize the same data point next to each other. This makes it easy to compare results at a glance. Filter and Break Down Dashboard Data Filters apply to all tiles on your dashboard. To add a filter: Next to the date range at the top of the page, select Add Filter . Choose what data type you want to filter by, such as NPS or Multi-Choice. The number next to the data type shows how many questions include that type of data. Choose the question to filter by. Set a rule for your filter.

Even if a respondent never reaches a question due to skip logic, the question will still appear in their individual response as skipped. Respondent Exited the Survey Early If a respondent exits the survey before clicking the Done button, they may never reach some of your required questions.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/filter-rules/,Filtering Survey Results,"Filtering Survey Results Creating Filter Rules Types of Filters How Filters Work Managing Filters Exporting & Sharing Filters Filtering Survey Results Filtering Survey Results Creating Filter Rules Types of Filters How Filters Work Managing Filters Exporting & Sharing Filters Filter rules allow you to break down your survey results and focus on specific parts of your data. For example, you can filter by question and answer to view respondents who answered a question a certain way. Or you can filter by completeness to view only complete responses. When designing your survey, think about how you want to filter your results. If you want to see responses by group, make sure to include a question in the survey that will allow you to filter by that group. For example, if you include a question in your survey asking employees to select their department, you can filter by question and answer to view only results from human resources department. To view only completed responses from the human resources department, you can also filter by completeness. Creating Filter Rules To create a filter rule: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select Rules from the toolbar, then click + Filter . Select a filter type . Choose the criteria you want to focus on. Click Apply . You'll see any active filters at the top of the page. We'll also show the number of responses included in your filter, compared to the number of responses in your survey. Types of Filters How Filters Work Filter Logic A single filter rule uses OR logic. This means any responses that fit at least one of the filter's criteria are shown. For example, if you're filtering by Question & Answer and select both answer options A and B, the filter will include responses from people who chose either answer option A OR answer option B. If you want to see all options except for one, you can create a NOT rule by selecting all options in the filter except the one you want to exclude. Using Multiple Filters You can apply multiple filter rules at the same time to narrow down your survey data even further. When multiple filters are applied at the same time, they're combined using AND logic. This means that only results that meet all filter rules are shown. For example, if you apply a filter rule by Question & Answer and select answer option B, then also apply a second filter rule for responses tagged ""human resources,"" your results will only show responses from people who chose answer option B AND have a response tagged ""human resources."" Combined Filters PAID FEATURE: Combined filters are only available to customers on some paid plans . Once you've created a few filters, you can combine two or more filters with AND, OR, or NOT logic to do more advanced filtering. To create a combined filter: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Create the filters you want to combine. Select Rules from the toolbar, then click + Filter . Click Combine multiple filters . In the Combined Filters window, use the dropdowns to select a condition and a filter. To use NOT logic, select Does not match . Click + Condition and use the dropdowns to add another filter to your combined filter. Click the And button to toggle between AND or OR logic. In the lower right corner, click Save . Your combined filter will be applied to your results. To find your filter later, select Rules from the toolbar. TIP! You can save combinations of filters as Views . If your survey is shared with a team , anything saved in the Analyze Results section is visible to all collaborators when they access the survey. Clear names make it easy for other collaborators to recognize and use views in their own analysis. Managing Filters Select Rules from the toolbar, then click the three dots menu next to a filter rule to unapply, edit, rename, copy or delete it. Select the filter name to turn it on or off. A green check mark ✅ next to a filter means that the filter is active. You'll also see any active filters at the top of the page. Exporting & Sharing Filters You can export your results with a filter applied or share your survey results with other people.

If you have data stored in our Canadian Data Center , this feature isn't available. You can see if this applies to you by checking your Account Details . How It Works A word cloud shows common important words and phrases survey-takers write in open-ended responses. Each phrase in a word cloud can be between 1-5 words. The word cloud can identify singular and plural words, tense variation, and other similar words and phrases, then groups them together to display as a single word. For example, if the words ""read,"" ""reads,"" and ""reading"" appear in your responses, the word cloud might group them together to display as ""read"". The word cloud also excludes some common words to highlight the important words in your responses. For example, if 100 people responded ""I like dogs,"" we'll identify ""dogs"" as the important word. Excluded words a, about, above, after, again, against, all, am, an, and, any, are, aren't, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, below, between, both, but, by, can, can't, cannot, com, could, couldn't, did, didn't, do, does, doesn't, doing, don't, down, during, each, else, ever, few, for, from, further, get, had, hadn't, has, hasn't, have, haven't, having, he, he'd, he'll, he's, her, here, here's, hers, herself, him, himself, his, how, how's, http, I, I'd, I'll, I'm, I've, if, in, into, is, isn't, it, it's, its, itself, just, k, let's, like, me, more, most, mustn't, my, myself, no, nor, not, of, off, on, once, only, or, other, ought, our, ours, ourselves, out, over, own, r, same, shall, shan't, she, she'd, she'll, she's, should, shouldn't, so, some, such, than, that, that's, the, their, theirs, them, themselves, then, there, there's, these, they, they'd, they'll, they're, they've, this, those, through, to, too, under, until, up, very, was, wasn't, we, we'd, we'll, we're, we've, were, weren't, what, what's, when, when's, where, where's, which, while, who, who's, whom, why, why's, with, won't, would, wouldn't, www, you, you'd, you'll, you're, you've, your, yours, yourself, yourselves a, about, above, after, again, against, all, am, an, and, any, are, aren't, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, below, between, both, but, by, can, can't, cannot, com, could, couldn't, did, didn't, do, does, doesn't, doing, don't, down, during, each, else, ever, few, for, from, further, get, had, hadn't, has, hasn't, have, haven't, having, he, he'd, he'll, he's, her, here, here's, hers, herself, him, himself, his, how, how's, http, I, I'd, I'll, I'm, I've, if, in, into, is, isn't, it, it's, its, itself, just, k, let's, like, me, more, most, mustn't, my, myself, no, nor, not, of, off, on, once, only, or, other, ought, our, ours, ourselves, out, over, own, r, same, shall, shan't, she, she'd, she'll, she's, should, shouldn't, so, some, such, than, that, that's, the, their, theirs, them, themselves, then, there, there's, these, they, they'd, they'll, they're, they've, this, those, through, to, too, under, until, up, very, was, wasn't, we, we'd, we'll, we're, we've, were, weren't, what, what's, when, when's, where, where's, which, while, who, who's, whom, why, why's, with, won't, would, wouldn't, www, you, you'd, you'll, you're, you've, your, yours, yourself, yourselves Available languages Word cloud is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch, French, Russian, Italian, Danish, Finnish, Hungarian, Norwegian, Romanian, and Swedish Word cloud is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch, French, Russian, Italian, Danish, Finnish, Hungarian, Norwegian, Romanian, and Swedish Viewing a Word Cloud Word cloud is available once you've collected at least 5 responses.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/response-statuses/,Survey Response Statuses,"Survey Response Statuses Individual Response Statuses Survey Response Statuses Survey Response Statuses Individual Response Statuses You can find the total number of responses to your survey in your survey's Summary tab. A survey response is one survey taker's submission of a survey, whether they completed the survey or only partially completed it. Responses are recorded in the Analyze Results section of your survey when survey takers click the navigation buttons in the survey. Responses are recorded when a survey taker completes a page of the survey and clicks the Next button to continue to the next page. Responses are recorded when a survey taker finishes the survey and clicks the Done button. If a respondent clicks Next or Done and they haven't answered a required question or they haven't properly answered a question with validation , they will see an error message. Their responses won't be recorded until they answer the question and click Next or Done again. Individual Response Statuses In the Individual Responses tab of your survey results, each response will have one of the following statuses: Respondents with complete responses may have skipped required questions in the survey due to logic in your survey design. Complete responses also include respondents who skip questions that weren't required. TIP! While response statuses are not included in exports, you can filter your survey results by response status or completeness to export results by response status.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/benchmark-data/,Benchmark Data,"Benchmark Data Your Profile & Organization Shared Surveys Opting Out of Benchmarks Benchmark Data Benchmark Data Your Profile & Organization Shared Surveys Opting Out of Benchmarks Benchmark data comes from SurveyMonkey customers who used Question Bank questions in their surveys. Organizations of all shapes and sizes use Question Bank, like local coffee shops, schools, and Fortune 500 companies. To calculate a SurveyMonkey Global Benchmark for each question, we (1) find an average response for each individual survey, then (2) add up those individual scores to generate an average across all surveys. We categorize responses into comparison groups based on factors like industry, size, and location to provide more targeted benchmarks. To focus on a particular segment of the SurveyMonkey Global Benchmark, you can buy Industry Benchmarks that only contain the responses from these comparison groups. To preserve privacy , responses for a given question are aggregated and de-identified to create a set of average statistics about that question—we don't disclose any individual responses, personal information, or organization names. Benchmark data is refreshed quarterly (every 3 months). TIP! You can buy Industry Benchmarks to help you narrow down the types of organizations included in a benchmark, like country, organization size, or industry. Your Profile & Organization When using SurveyMonkey, you may be asked to provide some profile information about yourself or your organization, such as your organization name or the industry you work in. Profile information allows us to: Customize your experience using Question Bank by showing you suggested questions. Create benchmarks from aggregated information about your Question Bank responses. Show you relevant benchmarks for certain Question Bank questions. You may be required to provide profile information in order to access certain benchmarks. You can edit your profile info anytime. To edit your profile: Go to My account . Scroll to General Preferences to find Profile . Edit the info about your survey intent and select Next . Select the types of surveys you want to send and select Next . You can also Delete your profile info at anytime. Shared Surveys If you're part of a team , you can share surveys with others. People with Full Access permissions can view all benchmarks (free or paid) on surveys shared with them. People with View Only access can only see the SurveyMonkey Global Benchmark on surveys shared with them. People don't need to complete their profile to view benchmarks on surveys shared with them. Benchmark data collected from Question Bank questions being used in shared surveys is attributed to the profile information in the survey owner's account, not to accounts a survey is shared with. Opting Out of Benchmarks If benchmarks are enabled in your account, survey responses to Question Bank questions you have used may be included in benchmarks on a de-identified and aggregated basis. You'll also be able to access benchmarks on eligible questions. You can opt out of contributing your responses to benchmarks. If you disable benchmarks, your survey responses will be excluded from the benchmarks the next time the system refreshes them—typically every week. Additionally, you'll no longer be able to view benchmarks if you haven't purchased benchmarks. To exclude your data from benchmarks: Log in and go to My Account . Scroll to the Data Features section. Click Edit next to Access to Benchmarks . Select Off . Click Save . For additional information about how we handle your personal information and data, please see our Privacy Notice .

You won't be able to see a benchmark if you changed the question type or edited the number of answer options for the question. You can still see a benchmark if you edited the question text. However, your comparisons might not be valid for benchmarks since your questions may have been interpreted differently by your respondents than by others who saw the questions as they were originally written. To preserve anonymity and to provide accurate comparisons, we have requirements on how much benchmark data we need in order to display benchmarks for a particular question. We're working hard to make sure that we have coverage in all of the questions we offer benchmarking. You can hide the benchmark for that question to see your results instead.

You can cancel auto-renew at any time to downgrade your subscription at the end of your paid time. Canceling auto-renew prevents your payment method from being charged at your next billing date, or if you pay by invoice, prevents your next invoice from being issued. Your current subscription (the time you already paid for) isn't affected, so you'll continue to be able to access and benefit from paid features until the plan downgrades on your next billing date . If you're located in the European Union and upgraded a new account within the past 14 days, you may also want to review our European Union Subscription Cancellation Policy . Canceling Auto-Renew Follow the steps below to cancel your subscription if you have your own plan or if you're the Primary Admin of a team . To cancel auto-renew: Review the below info on Special Cancellation Cases in case they refer to you. Log in to your SurveyMonkey account. Select your Profile circle in the upper-right corner. Select My Account . Select the Billing Details tab. Under the Billing Profile section, go to Auto-renew. Select the link next to the auto-renew setting to cancel auto-renew and follow the steps. Make sure to review the cancellation terms and date your account will downgrade. Switch to Invoicing Pay by Invoice to get an invoice to pay for your renewal instead of being charged automatically on your next billing date. What happens when I downgrade? When your plan downgrades , your plan type changes to Basic (our free plan). If you're canceling a team, all accounts will downgrade and the team will be dissolved. Special Cancellation Cases Outstanding Invoices If you currently have an unpaid invoice, you won't see the option to cancel auto-renew. Please contact us to cancel your account. Sales-Assisted Accounts If you worked with our sales team to set up your account, please contact us to cancel your account.

At the end of the suspension period, we'll close the account and delete all data in it. iOS App Accounts If you purchased a SurveyMonkey plan through the SurveyMonkey mobile app for iOS, billing is managed by Apple instead of SurveyMonkey.

If you only need a paid plan for a short amount of time, we offer a monthly plan . In accordance with our terms of services , when you cancel your subscription, previous charges won't be refunded unless legally required. Consumers in the European Union have refund rights described in our European Union Subscription Cancellation Policy . If you're located in another region where we're legally required to issue a refund on an early cancellation, or you have any questions about cancellations or refunds, please contact us . If you delete your individual account, you'll lose access to paid time left in your plan. During the deletion process, you're asked to explicitly agree to forfeit the remaining time in your current paid subscription and acknowledge that you won't be refunded for this unused time. If you delete an account on your team, you won't lose access to paid time left for their seat. Instead, their seat becomes available, and you can invite another person to the team at no additional cost . Inactive Accounts If you haven't logged into your free SurveyMonkey or SurveyMonkey Contribute account for more than 3 years we consider the account inactive and it will be permanently deleted.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/auto-renew/,Auto-Renew,"Auto-Renew Auto-Renew Auto-Renew Paid plans are subscriptions that auto-renew by default to ensure you don't lose access to paid features at your next billing date. You can check your auto-renew setting in the Billing Details tab of your account. If auto-renew is enabled , the subscription renews at your next billing date and you keep access to paid features. If auto-renew is disabled , the subscription doesn't renew at your next billing date. Instead, your account downgrades to a free plan and you lose access to paid features. You can cancel auto-renew at any time. This prevents your payment method from being charged at your next billing date, or if you pay by invoice, prevents your next invoice from being issued. How You're Billed Payment for your renewal is due at your next billing date. The way you're billed for your renewal depends on your payment method: TIP! If you'd like to be emailed an invoice to pay for your renewal rather than be charged automatically on your next billing date, you can request to pay by invoice . Your Next Billing Date Payment for your subscription renewal is due at your next billing date. Most plans auto-renew on an annual basis (every 12 months) on the same day each year. We also offer a monthly plan , which has several billing frequency options. To check your next billing date: Log in to your SurveyMonkey account. Click your username in the upper-right corner. Select My Account . Click the Billing Details tab. Look for Next Billing Date . Teams The renewal amount is for your whole team and depends on your team size .

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/billing-currency/,Billing Currency,"Billing Currency Changing Your Currency Currency Conversion International Transaction Fees Supported Currencies Unsupported Currencies Billing Currency Billing Currency Changing Your Currency Currency Conversion International Transaction Fees Supported Currencies Unsupported Currencies The currency you’re charged in depends on the billing country where your payment method is located. Before you complete a payment when signing up, upgrading, creating a team, or making a one-time purchase in your account, we make sure to clearly display the billing currency you'll be charged in right above the Confirm or Pay button. Changing Your Currency Your billing currency depends on your billing country. Your billing country needs to match the country where your payment method is located—you can't directly edit your billing currency since it's tied to your payment method. To edit your billing country: If you're signing up for a new account, you'll select your billing country on the checkout page. If you have an existing account, you can edit your billing country in the Payment Information section of the Billing Details tab. In some situations, you might not be able to edit your billing country when updating your payment method. If you run into this issue and see an error message, you can contact us for more info. TIP! If you pay for SurveyMonkey through the SurveyMonkey iOS app, billing is managed by Apple instead of SurveyMonkey. To change your billing currency, you'll need to update your Apple ID payment method. Currency Conversion The amount you're being charged in your local currency might not convert to our exact pricing in USD or in another market—this means if you use the current exchange rate to convert your local currency to USD, it might not match. Since SurveyMonkey is available all over the globe, our pricing can differ from country to country. To determine pricing in each market, we take currency fluctuation into account, as well as the price for similar services in a given market. We make sure to be as transparent as possible by showing you the exact amount you’ll be charged by SurveyMonkey and in what currency before you submit your payment. International Transaction Fees Your card issuer or bank may add a currency conversion or foreign transaction fee to your payment. If you have a larger than expected charge, please contact your provider for information on what rates and fees may apply, as these are not controlled by or known to SurveyMonkey. You may also be seeing a pre-authorization . Supported Currencies When you sign up, upgrade, create a team, or make a one-time purchase in your account, you'll be charged in the local currency of your billing country, if that currency is supported at the time of your purchase. Your plan subscription will renew at the billing currency you were charged previously, unless you edit your payment method and associated billing currency before renewal. If your billing country is not listed, the local currency for your billing country is not supported—see info on Unsupported Currencies . *If your payment method is located in a country where EUR is an official currency, your billing currency will be EUR. One-time Audience purchases are not currently available to customers in Brazil paying with BRL. Unsupported Currencies If your billing country is not supported at the time of your purchase, you'll be charged in USD. If your payment method is located in a European country whose currency is not supported, your billing currency may be EUR and not USD. This includes, but may not be limited to, Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine. If you were charged in USD or EUR, your plan subscription will also renew in USD or EUR, even if your local currency has become supportable since your original payment. There are a couple situations where you can switch to your local billing currency for your next renewal, if it's now a supported currency: If you're currently being billed in USD or EUR but your local billing currency is now supported, you can contact us to switch to your local billing currency for your next renewal. If you create a team , you'll be charged for additional users in your local currency if it's supported at the time you create the team (if this is the case, you'll see the price per user listed in the local currency in your account), and your plan subscription will be renewed in that local currency instead of USD or EUR at your next renewal date.

Please double-check your credit card information and try again. If you're unable to edit your billing information because the window is opening a blank page, please check your browser's security settings. If you have strict security settings, the window may not open properly. Try temporarily lowering your security settings or use a different browser. Re-enter your credit card details and billing address Most often, it’s something as simple as a typo or an old expiration date that’s causing the payment to fail. Don't use spaces or dashes in your card number. Additionally, make sure the billing address and postal code you enter matches the billing address and postal code on your credit card. Most often, it’s something as simple as a typo or an old expiration date that’s causing the payment to fail. Don't use spaces or dashes in your card number.

If your billing information is accurate and your charge still won't go through, your card issuer may be blocking the payment. Card-issuing banks have many security measures in place for online purchases and subscriptions, especially when a card is being used for the first time. Pre-Authorization Charges A pre-authorization charge or fee is a temporary funds hold that may show up on your credit card or banking statement as a pending charge. It's a test transaction commonly used by online retailers to make sure the card is valid before running the full charge. If the pre-authorization fee is refused by the bank or credit card company, the full charge is cancelled, and the purchase won't be processed. When you update credit card details or billing contact information in your SurveyMonkey account, we sometimes place a pre-authorization like this on the card—it's just to make sure the new details are valid. This temporary authorization is not a permanent charge. It should be automatically removed from the card in the next few days (typically within 7 business days, depending on the bank) and the funds restored to your account. The void may be listed as a refund, or the pre-authorization fee may simply be deleted from your account history since it wasn't a real charge. International Transaction Fees Your card issuer or bank may add a currency conversion or foreign transaction fee to your payment. If you have a larger than expected charge, please contact your provider for information on what rates and fees may apply, as these are not controlled by or known to SurveyMonkey. Charges on Expired or Outdated Cards If your card has been updated but the card information in your SurveyMonkey account is out of date, you may see the charge posted to your new card. When a payment is sent to a card issuer, our payment processor uses the card details stored in the SurveyMonkey account. If this information is outdated, the card issuer has two options: they can choose to use this information to accept the charge and post it on the updated card, or they can decline the charge. If they accept the charge and post it on the updated card, on our end we may see the outdated card details or the updated card details. This is a relatively common situation when customers receive an updated card—the card issuer often continues to accept charges made to the outdated card for some time because they don’t want their customers to lose access to any paid subscriptions, like SurveyMonkey.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/downgrading/,Downgrading Your Plan,"Downgrading Your Plan Downgrading to a lower tier paid plan Downgrading a Team or Enterprise account Downgrading to a free plan (Auto-renew off or non-payment) Special Downgrade Cases Downgrading Your Plan Downgrading Your Plan Downgrading to a lower tier paid plan Downgrading a Team or Enterprise account Downgrading to a free plan (Auto-renew off or non-payment) Special Downgrade Cases There are situations where you may find the need to downgrade your SurveyMonkey plan. In these cases, you can either downgrade to a lower tier paid plan, or our Basic (free) plan, with limited creation and analysis capabilities, 10 questions per survey or form, and fewer responses . In this article, we detail limitations you may run into after downgrading to a free or different paid plan . Downgrading to a lower tier paid (or free) plan What happens to my account when I downgrade? Survey and forms created before downgrading your plan, may include paid features no longer available on your current plan. Additionally, responses over a survey’s response limit may not be viewable. When you create new surveys, you can only send them with features available on the plan you currently have. If you add paid features not available in your current plan, we let you know that you need to upgrade to a different plan to send your survey. Check out the Plans & Pricing page to see which features are available on the plan you’ve selected and compare them with your previous plan. What happens if I upgrade my account again? You can upgrade your account again from the Plans & Pricing page any time. If you upgrade to a different plan than you had before, you might be limited on what features you can use. When this happens, we'll show you what features are no longer on your plan when you try to send a survey. To keep those paid features, re-upgrade your account to send your survey or form. If you don't want to upgrade, you will need to remove the paid features before sending your survey or form. Learn more . For example, if you have a feature on your survey that is only available on the Premier plan. You won’t be able to send that survey again unless you remove the feature, or upgrade to the Premier plan again. Downgrading a Teams or Enterprise account What happens to my team when I downgrade? If a Primary Admin does not renew, your account is put on hold for 30 days, in case your payment is late. After the grace period, users are removed from the team, and all accounts are downgraded to Basic (free) plans. Surveys are only accessible within the original survey creator’s individual account and survey sharing is turned off. Responses that exceed your Basic plan’s response limit will be deleted in accordance with our data retention period — 365 days from the date the response was collected. Individual account owners can delete responses over the account limit at any time. What happens if I upgrade my account again? If the Primary Admin re-upgrades their account, it doesn't automatically re-create the team. Each user will need a new invite to join the team again. Downgrading to a free plan (Auto-renew off or non-payment) After cancelling auto-renew , in most cases, your account will downgrade to a free plan at your next billing date. Similarly, if you have an invoice that remains unpaid a few weeks after the billing date, your account will be downgraded to a free plan. To keep your paid plan active, you’ll need make a payment before your next billing date or choose a different paid plan . What happens to my survey data? When your account downgrades, responses over a survey’s response limit aren’t viewable and may be deleted after a 30 day grace period. To view and keep access to all of your responses, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan again before they're deleted. You can go to My Surveys or the new Homepage (beta) to see which surveys have responses over your plan's limit. After the grace period ends, over-limit responses collected more than 365 days from the date they were collected will be automatically deleted — in accordance with our data retention policy. Deleted responses can’t be restored. However, if for legal compliance reasons, such as data subject requests, you need to access specific over-limit responses that have not been yet deleted, contact our support team. As long as your account remains downgraded, responses collected more than 365 days prior that are over your response limit will continue to be deleted. You can also delete all responses over your account limit at any time. Will my surveys continue to work? Yes, but keep in mind the free plan (and lower paid plans) may have a different set of features than what you had before. When you create new surveys, you can only send them with features available on the plan you currently have. If you add additional paid features, we let you know that you need to upgrade to a different plan to send your survey. Survey restrictions while on the free plan When your account downgrades, some paid features in live surveys continue to work, but with restrictions. Design Restrictions There's a limit of 10 questions per survey, which includes text and images . If you have live surveys with more than 10 questions, we don't delete any questions, but you may run into editing restrictions. You can only copy surveys with 10 questions or less. You may not be able to edit questions on survey templates with more than 10 questions. You can't add logic to your surveys. If existing surveys use logic, they continue to work as long as the collector was open at the time the account downgraded. You may have previously had a plan that allowed you to hide the SurveyMonkey footer.

If you're interested, contact sales . If you already have an Enterprise account, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Does HIPAA apply to me? If you are a “covered entity” (as defined by HIPAA) and are using SurveyMonkey to collect or store protected health information (generally any information about the health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual, such as an individual’s name and/or contact details combined with information about health care that the individual received), then HIPAA likely applies to your use of SurveyMonkey. If you don’t need HIPAA but do need a higher level of security when using SurveyMonkey to collect or store information, check out the Enhanced Sensitive Data Protection feature . The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a United States law that regulates the collection and handling of “protected health information” (PHI). Certain organizations called “covered entities” and their business associates are required to comply with HIPAA. For SurveyMonkey, being ""HIPAA-compliant"" means that we offer a service that enables covered entities to collect and manage PHI through surveys in a manner compliant with HIPAA. As part of offering this service, SurveyMonkey ensures that it operates in a way that is consistent and compatible with those laws and SurveyMonkey's role as a business associate to a covered entity user. In accordance with our Terms of Use , SurveyMonkey only permits PHI to be collected by regulated entities if it is done through a “HIPAA-enabled account” with a business associate agreement (BAA) in place. However, SurveyMonkey does not require you to have a BAA if you are not regulated by HIPAA with respect to the PHI you collect in your surveys. HIPAA Features HIPAA Security Measures that SurveyMonkey Employs As required by HIPAA, we implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic PHI that we receive, maintain, and transmit on behalf of covered entities with respect to their HIPAA-enabled accounts. These safeguards include measures required by the Security Rule, such as: Regular risk assessments of systems to ensure that safeguards remain relevant and effective Assigned security team which is responsible for maintaining compliance with HIPAA’s security requirements Screening, authorization, and training of SurveyMonkey staff who come into contact with customer PHI Data backup plans Disaster recovery plans Systems regularly monitored, updated, and patched Incident response plan that includes reporting of security incidents to affected covered entities All communications with SurveyMonkey servers encrypted with SSL For more information, see our Security Statement .

Feature List When you enable HIPAA-compliant features, the following features required by HIPAA are activated on your account. These features help covered entities to comply with their own HIPAA obligations: Security reminders : We remind users of their HIPAA obligations with in-product messages that appear whenever they perform certain sensitive operations on PHI (such as exporting survey data that could potentially be shared with third parties). Automatic logoff : We timeout user sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity. Logging : We log account access activity and a variety of events relating to HIPAA-enabled accounts by timestamp, identity (IP Address and/or account username), and event type. While there isn't a way to access these logs within your account—you can contact us to request logs.

Enabling HIPAA Features SurveyMonkey offers a standard form BAA which meets the requirements of HIPAA. If you're interested in enabling HIPAA features on your account, please contact us . If you've already entered into a BAA with us, you can contact us to receive a copy of your BAA. Once an account is HIPAA-enabled, it cannot be reverted to a non-HIPAA account. If the BAA is terminated, your account will also be closed. See the Downgrades section below for more information. Downgrades Review the common questions below to understand how downgrades work for HIPAA-enabled accounts. Can I downgrade my HIPAA-enabled account or team to a lower plan type? No. Once you enable HIPAA-compliant features on your account or Enterprise team, it cannot be reverted back to a regular, non-HIPAA-enabled account. If you want to remove HIPAA-compliant features from your account, or if you want a lower plan, you must open a new account. Note that you can transfer surveys from your HIPAA-enabled account to a regular account, but you must be very careful not to transfer any surveys that contain PHI (we do not permit users to store PHI in regular accounts, and regular accounts are not covered by a BAA).

What happens if I don't renew my HIPAA-enabled account or team? If you decide you no longer need to use SurveyMonkey and don't renew your HIPAA-enabled account, your account will be placed into a suspended state. While suspended, SurveyMonkey will preserve all data contained within the account and continue to treat it in accordance with the BAA. However, you will not be able to access your survey data or account directly (except for limited billing and account administration functions). SurveyMonkey will retain a suspended account for a period of time in order to provide you with an opportunity to unsuspend your account by renewing it. If your account is suspended and you need access to your data or want to close your account, please contact us . At the end of the suspension period, SurveyMonkey will close your account and delete all data in it.

How Respondent Authentication and Anonymous Responses work together Because the Respondent Authentication feature always records the SSO profile information for everyone that takes the survey, responses can't be anonymous when Respondent Authentication is turned on. So, while you're able to turn on both Respondent Authentication and Anonymous Responses by default in Settings, both of these settings won't actually be reflected in new Web Link collectors your team creates. Instead, Respondent Authentication will remain turned on, and responses won't be anonymous. If Respondent Authentication is unlocked and Anonymous Responses is locked, people in your team can turn off Respondent Authentication, and the Anonymous Responses setting will automatically update to match the locked default setting.

What Your Team Will See Collector Options The team's default settings are automatically applied to new collectors. If the default setting is locked, team members can't change the setting.

Change the Primary Admin If you can’t log into the Primary Admin account, contact support. The Primary Admin can edit their account details (name, email address, etc.) to the new person's. However, steps to complete this process depend on whether the new person is already on the team: Change to someone who isn't on the team yet To change the Primary Admin: Log into your Primary Admin account in SurveyMonkey. Change the email address on your account to the email address of the person you want to be the new Primary Admin. Change to someone who is on the team Changing the Primary Admin to someone else that's already part of your team is a multi-step process, so we'll start with an example. EXAMPLE In this example, Cindy and Deanna are already part of the same team. Cindy is the Primary Admin, and Deanna is a Full User. Cindy wants to make Deanna the new Primary Admin instead. Here's what needs to happen: 1. Deanna transfers all of her surveys to Cindy's Primary Admin account. 2. Cindy deletes Deanna's Full User account from the team. 3. Cindy changes the email address on her own account to Deanna's email address. 4. Deanna is now the Primary Admin and Cindy is no longer in the team. If you're the current Primary Admin, follow these steps to switch the Primary Admin to someone else that's already on your team: Before you do anything, ask the other person to log in to their account and transfer their surveys to the current Primary Admin account. Log in to the Primary Admin account in SurveyMonkey. Select My Team from the main navigation. Select Manage Users . Find the person who you want to be the new Primary Admin. If their email address is linked to multiple SurveyMonkey accounts, you will need to contact support or choose different email address for the Primary Admin account. Delete their account from the team . Change the email address on your account to the email address of the new person. If the original Primary Admin still needs to be in the team, the new Primary Admin can invite them to fill the open seat at no additional cost. If you change the email address on your account to someone else, you'll lose access to the account and all surveys and data within it. You won't be a part of the team anymore unless the new Primary Admin invites you to join the team. If you can’t log into the Primary Admin account, contact support. The Primary Admin can edit their account details (name, email address, etc.) to the new person's.

How it Works A Custom Sender Name and Email Domain lets you specify the display name and email address when you send surveys with the Email Invitation . It's what survey-takers see in the From field of the email asking them to take your survey. It replaces the SurveyMonkey sender name and email . Using a Custom Sender Name and Email Domain makes it more likely for your emails to be delivered and for survey-takers to open the survey and respond when they recognize your familiar and trusted brand. Team members can then choose to update the display name and local name when selecting their email's collector options. Replies to Email Invitations Your Primary Admin can also choose a reply-to email address for any bounced emails or replies to email invitations sent using the Custom Sender Name and Email Domain.

We recommend using a subdomain of your company’s domain. (Optional) Reply-to email address Update your DNS Your CSM will send you DKIM/CNAME and MX/SPF records that your IT department needs to add to your DNS. Let us know once this is complete so your CSM can confirm everything looks good from our side. Otherwise, they can help you troubleshoot. Start sending branded Email Invitations The Primary Admin should let team members with Custom Sender Name and Email Domain turned on know what to expect, including where replies to emails will go.

Division Libraries and Survey Controls ENTERPRISE FEATURE: Only available on some Enterprise plans. If you're interested, contact sales . If you already have an Enterprise account, contact your Customer Success Manager. How It Works When your team has Divisions —sub-groups within your team that can be managed independently of one another—each division can have its own division library with its own set of assets. A division library allows each division to have unique assets that are different from the assets in the team library and other divisions. Division members can use the assets from the team library or their division library, which ensures all surveys meet either the team's or division’s unique branding needs.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/teams/single-sign-on/,Single Sign-On (SSO),"Single Sign-On (SSO) How SSO Works Setting Up SSO Logging In and Managing Login Credentials Troubleshooting Login Errors Enabling Respondent Authentication Single Sign-On (SSO) Single Sign-On (SSO) How SSO Works Setting Up SSO Logging In and Managing Login Credentials Troubleshooting Login Errors Enabling Respondent Authentication How SSO Works ENTERPRISE FEATURE: Single Sign On (SSO) Single Sign-On (SSO) lets everyone on your Enterprise team log in to SurveyMonkey using your organization’s corporate login credentials. SSO removes the need to maintain a separate SurveyMonkey username and password. Your organization can control who can access your SurveyMonkey team and create authentication policies for increased security. SurveyMonkey’s SSO solution follows the S​AML 2.0 specification and is Service Provider (SP) initiated. SSO glossary Term Description Service Provider (SP) A vendor that provides services to your organization. In relation to SSO, the SP is SurveyMonkey. Identity Provider (IdP) A company that provides user authentication services. IdPs manage whether an employee can access a SP, like SurveyMonkey or other applications. Okta and ADFS are common IdPs. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) The language the IdP and SP communicate in. SurveyMonkey follows the SAML 2.0 technical specifications to exchange info with your organization's IdP. Attributes Pieces of info about an employee that an IdP uses for authentication. SurveyMonkey requires 4 attributes—FirstName, LastName, Email, and NameID. Claim Types Pieces of info about a user on a team that SurveyMonkey accepts. Attributes from your IdP need to be mapped to SurveyMonkey claims so SSO works correctly. Assertion An assertion is made up of one or more statements. SurveyMonkey requires certain attribute statements in our assertions. Setting Up SSO After your organization upgrades to an Enterprise plan, you'll be given the option to set up SSO for your team's account—only 1 IdP per Enterprise team. We'll then contact your team’s Primary Admin to start the setup process and connect with your IT department. We recommend waiting to invite people to your Enterprise team until SurveyMonkey confirms that SSO is set up properly. TIP! If you already have an Enterprise plan, reach out to your CSM to get set up with SSO. Here's a high-level breakdown of what to expect when setting up SSO: Input and map metadata Your unique SurveyMonkey metadata (Entity ID and ACS URL) is provided to you by your Technical Solutions Manager. Mapping guide Example IdP attributes Claim types SurveyMonkey accepts Mapping Unique, non-changing identifier (e.g. UPN or employee ID) NameID Required Email, emailaddress Email Required FirstName, first.name, givenname, Given-Name FirstName Required Surname LastName Required Department, DepartmentID, department name Department Optional* CostCenter, cost center number CostCenterCode Optional* * Optional attributes can help you track and monitor team activity in the User Report . * Optional attributes can help you track and monitor team activity in the User Report . Send us your metadata Send SurveyMonkey your organization's metadata URL. If you’re unable to send the metadata URL, provide the XML file. We'll set up SSO in our system and send you steps to validate that it's working correctly. We need the following from you: Entity ID HTTP Redirect Endpoint X.509 Certificate (specifically the Signing KeyType) SurveyMonkey will set up SSO in our system and send you steps to validate that it's working correctly. Invite employees to access SurveyMonkey If you want to restrict some employees from accessing your team, you can use a security group to permit or deny claims on the IdP side.

Require survey takers to log in with SSO Respondent Authentication on the Web Link collector only requires survey takers to log in through SSO to access your survey, without needing a SurveyMonkey account. Responses are tracked with their SSO metadata—first name, last name, and email address. It isn't possible to make responses anonymous when Respondent Authentication is turned on. Respondent Authentication is for surveys taken on personal devices—don't enable Respondent Authentication on a public or shared device. To turn on Respondent Authentication: Log in to SurveyMonkey using your organization’s corporate login credentials ( SSO ). Go to the Collect Response section of your survey. Add a Web Link collector. Or, click the name of an existing Web Link. Click Respondent Authentication . Select On, your respondents need to authenticate to take your survey .

If your SurveyMonkey account is linked to Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft, or Apple and you use those credentials to log in or you're part of an Enterprise team with Single Sign-On (SSO) set up—You'll not be able to use 2FA.

Soon, you'll log in using your email address instead of a username. This article has details to help you prepare for the transition. What's Changing We're transitioning to logging in with your email address instead of username. If you have multiple SurveyMonkey accounts with the same email address, they will be linked. This way, you can log in once then switch between your accounts. This affects: SurveyMonkey desktop and mobile apps SurveyMonkey Rewards SurveyMonkey Contribute What's not changing Your plan(s), billing details, or payment methods are not changing. Your surveys and survey responses will stay separate. If you have multiple accounts, they will stay separated by username. The difference is, you'll log in once with your email address and be able to switch between them. If you log in with SSO, your SSO account will stay separate. What You Need to Do Login to your account , and make sure you're able to access all your accounts, go to the My Account page and confirm your email address on file is valid, up to date, and one you have access to. If it's not, please update it so you're able to log in after the transition. Accounts will be linked by email address. If you have multiple SurveyMonkey accounts, check the email address for all of them. If you have accounts you don't want linked, change the email address to one that isn't on another SurveyMonkey account. Linking Multiple Accounts Multiple accounts only This section only applies if you have multiple usernames associated with the same email address. If you only have one username associated with your email address, you won't need to follow these steps. Depending on where you're located, when you log in after June 13 or June 20th, 2022, you will need to verify your email address and set up one password for all SurveyMonkey accounts associated with it. You'll only need to do this process once: On the login page , enter your email address instead of your username. This is the email address you have listed on your SurveyMonkey account. Follow the prompts to verify your email address and create a new password. Then you can review your linked accounts and choose one to log in to. You're all set! Next time you log in, use your email address and new password to access all your accounts in one place. Not getting the verification email? Check your spam or junk folder. If you still don't see it, add our IP addresses and email domains to your allow list, then request another code to make sure it comes through. How to switch between accounts After you've logged in and verified your email address, you can choose which account you want to log into. When you're ready to switch, click your email/username at the top right of your account and click Switch accounts . Then choose which account you want to go to next. If you don't see a username on this list, it may mean there's a different email address associated with it. You need to log in with that email address to access that account.

After the deadline, you’ll need to log in using your email address and reset your password. If you have multiple accounts, your accounts will automatically be linked at this time.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/policy/are-responses-anonymous/,Are my survey responses anonymous and secure?,"Are my survey responses anonymous and secure? Are my survey responses anonymous and secure? Are my survey responses anonymous and secure? Anonymity Survey creators can decide to collect responses anonymously or to track respondents . Personal information can be collected by a survey creator in two ways: (1) by expressly asking you for your personal details in the survey and (2) by configuring the survey collector options to automatically collect certain information. We provide several survey distribution methods called collectors. Every collector type has different settings or collector options that affect the survey-taking experience and what respondent information is recorded. All collectors allow the survey creator to turn Anonymous Responses on or off. All collectors allow the survey creator to track IP addresses or not. Email Invitation collectors allow the survey creator to track email invitations . Some integrations create collectors automatically in SurveyMonkey. An integration's anonymity settings determine whether SurveyMonkey collectors record identifying information about the survey taker. For example, Microsoft Teams records the First and Last name of survey takers, unless Keep responses anonymous was selected. Remember to consider in each case where you use anonymous settings, and whether the questions you are asking could identify a person in any case. For example, this may happen if you are only surveying a small pool of people and the questions collect demographic data (e.g., male/female, age range, etc.) that could imply identity. In such cases, you may want to describe your survey as “confidential”, “pseudonymous” or “partially de-identified” instead. Privacy Survey creators may have their own privacy policies which apply to surveys that they create using our services and that detail how they handle your personally identifiable information or personal data. We encourage you to read any such policy, or to contact the survey creator directly to ask them any questions about their privacy practices. If the survey creator has not disclosed the collection method in the introduction of the survey, please contact them to verify if the response is anonymous. Review our Privacy Notice and how we handle respondents’ personal information. Security SurveyMonkey takes our users’ security and privacy concerns seriously. We strive to ensure that user data is kept secure, and that we collect only as much personal data as is required to make our users’ experience with SurveyMonkey as efficient and satisfying as possible. We also aim to collect data in the most unobtrusive manner possible. We aim to be transparent about our security infrastructure and practices to help reassure you that your data is sufficiently protected. SurveyMonkey is also ISO27001 certified. For more details, see our Security Statement . Surveys begin with https:// which means your survey responses are sent over a secure, encrypted connection.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/policy/protecting-account-data/,Protecting Your SurveyMonkey Account and Data,"Protecting Your SurveyMonkey Account and Data Your Account Your Password and Email Your Data Protecting Your SurveyMonkey Account and Data Protecting Your SurveyMonkey Account and Data Your Account Your Password and Email Your Data Your Account One person per account We take data privacy and security seriously, which is why sharing accounts is against our Terms of Use . Each SurveyMonkey account is meant for one person. Sharing login details opens your account to risk of a potential breach. As an account holder, you're not just protecting your own personal info, you're responsible for all the data you collect—like customer contact info, private research, protected health info, or employee data. Work with other accounts Everyone you're working with should have their own account with their own username and password. We have some great ways you can work with other people on surveys , no matter what kind of SurveyMonkey account you have. Your Password and Email Never share your password You should be the only one who knows your password. If you suspect your account has been accessed by someone else, change your password immediately. Create a strong, hard-to-guess password A good password contains more than 8 characters and has numbers, upper and lower case letters, as well as special characters. The longer the password, the better. Avoid using names, birthdays, common dates, and obvious words or phrases that describe the website the password is for. Using a mnemonic is a clever way to create a complex and memorable password—just memorize a phrase and use the first letter of each word for your password. For example, if you like to run in the park three times a week , your password could be RitP3XaW! Don't use the same password for other sites Avoid using the same password for all websites, apps, and online services you use. Since it’s difficult to remember all your passwords and you should never write them down, consider using a password manager to securely manage all your passwords. Make sure your email account is secure The tips in this section are helpful for your email password too. If someone accesses your email account (like Gmail, Yahoo!, or Outlook), they could reset your email password and gain access to other online accounts, like SurveyMonkey. You can change the email address on file to ensure your SurveyMonkey account's secure. You should be the only person with access to your email account and avoid using generic, role-based, or list-serv email addresses like info@, admin@, or sales@yourcompany.com for your SurveyMonkey account. Your Data Restrict access to shared data When you create a read-only shared data page to share your results with others, you can password-protect the page to restrict access to only those that know the password. If you're on a team plan , you can share surveys to give others access to the Survey Design, Collect Responses, or Analyze Results sections and set the appropriate permissions for each person. You can also use the Library to securely store and share brand assets, like images and survey templates, with everyone on your team. Keep your data in company hands If there are multiple people in your organization using SurveyMonkey, create a team and choose to let your organization retain ownership of data in employee accounts in the event that someone leaves the company. Follow our HIPAA security tips If you're a covered entity with a HIPAA-enabled account, review our HIPAA Security Tips to ensure that you handle PHI data securely.

Because our paid services are primarily intended for use by businesses and professional users, your account type is set as Business by default. Team and Enterprise accounts are always considered Business accounts. However, if you have a paid, individual plan and you are primarily using our service for personal, family or household purposes, we ask that you log in to your account and update your account type to Consumer (Personal) so that we may better understand such personal use of our platform and services. Changing Your Account Type First, in the Account Details section of the My Account page, click Edit next to Business in the Account type field. Then, on the Account type screen, select the Consumer (Personal) option, and click Save . Ownership of Accounts The owner of your account and the data in it depends on your plan type listed in the Account Details section of the My Account page. Enterprise and Team Plans If you have an Enterprise or Team account, we regard the organization to be the owner of the team and all the accounts on that team. This makes it easier for organizations to ensure they retain ownership and control of all surveys and survey data contained in the User, Admin, and Primary Admin accounts. SurveyMonkey doesn’t claim ownership of the survey questions your organization creates or responses it collects through its accounts. The organization, or a verified representative of it, is responsible for payment obligations and has the ability to manage all the team's accounts—even if that representative is not an account holder. Individual Plans If you have an individual plan and have not joined a team, the email address listed in My Account is considered the sole owner of, and is accountable for, the account and information created and collected using our system. If your email address is a work email address, then your organization will be considered accountable for the account and information created and collected using our system.

If you collect personal data, let survey takers know how you plan to use their data. Also, we encourage you to seek your own legal advice to comply with privacy laws and regulations. Limit Collecting and Storing Personal Information To avoid collecting personal data in surveys, make responses anonymous and don't ask for sensitive information , whenever possible. If you do collect personal information, think about how long you need it and why it needs to be stored in your SurveyMonkey account. Don't store personal information for longer than necessary. Review the survey data saved in your account regularly and delete it when it's no longer needed. Tell People How You Handle Data Sharing your privacy practices with survey takers may help ease their data concerns and increase your response rate . Describe your privacy practices in a survey introduction or in the email inviting people to take your survey. You can also add a hyperlink directly to your privacy notice. When making use of a feature that leverages artificial intelligence and/or machine learning in SurveyMonkey, remember to be transparent about this usage in your privacy notices. These features are usually clearly marked or you can read about them in this Help Center. You can use skip logic to disqualify respondents who don't agree with your privacy notice or practices. Privacy statements often include: What personal information you're collecting : Identify if you're making responses anonymous or tracking responses with email address, phone number, or other personal information collected in your survey or stored in your collector. How you plan to use the data : Say why you're sending your survey and what you want to do with the data collected. Whether you intend to share survey data : Clarify who will have access to the data. Whether survey takers can edit their responses : Let people know if they can edit their responses . How survey takers can contact you: Include an email address or contact form to get in touch. TIP! You can link to our Privacy Notice and Security Statement to share how we handle data. Be Aware of Your Company's Privacy Requirements It’s your responsibility to be aware of your organization's data privacy laws, regulations, and internal policies. Make sure your survey complies with these as well.

These are criteria that most university IRB ’s recommend when using an online survey tool to collect data. It is important to engage your Institutional Review Board to approve. Obtaining Written Permission to Conduct Research Using SurveyMonkey We are happy to assist you with getting the approvals you need to perform your student research. Here is a letter on SurveyMonkey letterhead that you can provide to your IRB to evidence permission to use the SurveyMonkey platform to conduct your research: Permission to Conduct Research Using SurveyMonkey (PDF) Secure Transmission Disable IP address tracking to make the survey anonymous. Informed Consent Include a consent form on the first page of your survey. SurveyMonkey records the respondent time stamp. This is important especially for respondents that consented to taking your survey. The survey should allow for “no response “or “prefer not to respond” as an option for every survey question. A survey where a respondent cannot proceed without answering the question is in violation of the respondent’s right to withhold information. At the end of the survey, the respondent should be given an option to withdraw from survey.

These are not from us—they’re sent by scammers using our name to trick people into sending money or personal info. Our legal team is aware of the illegal use of the SurveyMonkey name and have contacted the appropriate authorities to track down these perpetrators. We urge you to keep an eye out and help report any illegal scams that you come across. Each section below provides you with links to report different types of scams. Contact us if you think you found a scam not mentioned on this page. Social Media Paid Studies & Research Scams I've been offered weekly payment for a research study on Facebook or Instagram. Is this from SurveyMonkey? We’re aware of fraudulent advertisements and phishing emails, posing as SurveyMonkey, that ask people to take part in paid research opportunities—usually for weekly payments. They encourage people to visit websites, take screenshots, or download content to participate in research for payment. This is a scam and isn’t offered by SurveyMonkey. We’re not currently soliciting participation in this type of paid research on social media sites like Facebook or Instagram. Our legal and security teams are aware of these scams and working with authorities. How can I tell if a SurveyMonkey research opportunity is a scam? SurveyMonkey does not directly pay for research using PayPal, Venmo, or CashApp. If an opportunity appears to come from SurveyMonkey and mentions these payment methods, it's a scam. Always check the sender email and domain closely. If you have any doubts, contact us . Job Scams Someone offered me a job to work remotely for SurveyMonkey—is this real? Scammers have posed as SurveyMonkey HR representatives to try and obtain personal or banking information from individuals. These scams aim at getting your banking information by asking you to wire money, or buy electronic equipment online. As a general rule, do not wire money to anyone you don’t know personally! How can I tell if my job offer is a scam? Look at the sender email address domain—if it's from a generic email account, like @gmail.com or @yahoo.com, it's a scam. SurveyMonkey email addresses end in @surveymonkey.com. If someone claims to have found your resume on Craigslist, it is a scam. SurveyMonkey does not recruit from Craigslist. If someone sends you a check claiming to be from SurveyMonkey, it is a scam and the check will bounce. SurveyMonkey does not issue checks to pay our employees. If someone asks you to send them money or buy your own equipment, it is a scam. SurveyMonkey provides our employees with the equipment they need to perform their jobs. Where can I report this scam? Report the scam to the FBI: FBI - Internet Crime Complaint Center If you're located in Canada, report the scam here: Canada — Reporting Fraud If the scammer contacts you with a Gmail email address, report their email account to Google’s abuse team: G oogle Gmail Abuse Check Scams I got a check for a customer evaluation program—is this from SurveyMonkey? No, the check and letter you received are not from SurveyMonkey, but from scammers impersonating the SurveyMonkey name. This is part of a known scam called the Counterfeit Check-Facilitated “Mystery Shopper” scam. Check out the Federal Trade Commission Mystery Shopping Scam Information to learn more about this type of scam. We don't operate any ""mystery shopper"" jobs. The phone number and fax number you've been provided aren't ours, and the people who answer the number, if you choose to call, are not SurveyMonkey employees. We are aware of dozens of people who have been targeted by this scam. If you're a recipient, please contact your local law enforcement officers, the U.S. postal inspector, and your bank to warn them of the fraud. What do the checks look like? Check out these examples of counterfeit checks that have included in these scam packages. As counterfeit checks, they will bounce if you attempt to deposit them. What can I do to stop this scam? Report the scam packages to the U.S. postal inspector: USPS Mail Fraud Complaint Form If the scam package came from Canada, report it here: Canada—Reporting Fraud Coupon Scams Can I use a SurveyMonkey coupon I found online? No, don't try to redeem that coupon. While we allow our users to offer their own coupons, SurveyMonkey itself does not provide coupons to survey respondents or customers. We've seen a number of fake coupons being circulated that claim to be powered by SurveyMonkey or provided in exchange for responding to a SurveyMonkey survey, particularly in the context of fast food restaurants, nutritional supplement discounts, and Visa gift cards. These coupons are not valid and have used the SurveyMonkey name and logo without permission to trick people into thinking they are real. How to identify a fake coupon If a coupon has our logo on it, but claims to be redeemable at another company, it's a scam. Here are some example of scam coupons . They are counterfeits and won't be accepted if you try to use them. Phishing Surveys Phishing is the attempt by scammers to obtain sensitive, personal information (such as your usernames, passwords, credit card details, etc.). If you come across a survey that's phishing for this type of info, don't fill it out. To help you identify what is appropriate survey behavior, check out our Acceptable Uses Policy . Phone Support Scams I found a phone number online for SurveyMonkey customer support. Is this SurveyMonkey? Scammers have posted phone numbers online posing as SurveyMonkey customer support. When called, scammers try to obtain sensitive, personal, or billing information from individuals. SurveyMonkey does not list a support phone number online—you can contact us from our Help Center.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). The integration setup is only available in English. If you’re sending a web link from the Salesforce integration , you can encrypt custom variables. Encryption protects user data by preventing respondents from seeing or editing the custom variables in your web link. Need more help with the Salesforce integration? Check out our Getting Started guide >> There are a few steps you need to take to set up encryption: Map your survey to Salesforce Create a web link collector in the Salesforce integration Turn on encryption Get an encryption key from your Primary Admin (this may be you) Set up encryption in Salesforce (we’ll provide instructions below) Send your survey Read these instructions to get started. Work with a Salesforce administrator to complete these steps, if possible - you may need to build custom code for your environment. SurveyMonkey’s support team can’t consult on coding issues in Salesforce. Before you Start Reach out to your Customer Success Manager to get the Encryption feature enabled. You’ll only need to get it enabled once. Map Your Survey to Salesforce Create your survey mappings. You can use our managed package or create your own mappings to standard and custom Salesforce objects. Learn how >> Create a Salesforce Web Link Collector Create a web link collector in the Salesforce integration. Make sure to add any custom variables you’d like to collect from your respondents. Learn how >> Turn on Encryption and Copy Link Once you’ve created your web link, toggle on the option to Encrypt custom variables . We’ll show you an encrypted version of your survey link to send. However, this link won’t work until you set up encryption in Salesforce. You’ll see instructions to set up encryption and a code sample. Copy this code sample to use later. You can always come back to this page and copy it later. Get an Encryption Key from your Primary Admin Ask your Primary Admin to create an encryption key and provide it to you. To generate an encryption key: As a Primary Admin, go to the header and select My Team > Settings . Select Encryption key for Salesforce at the bottom of the page (you may need to scroll). Select Generate key . Copy the key and provide it to the person setting up encryption in Salesforce. They’ll add this key to the encryption code in Salesforce. Make sure to store the key somewhere safe – we won’t show it again once you leave the encryption key page. If you lose this key, the Primary Admin can generate a new one later. Set up Encryption in Salesforce To set up encryption in Salesforce: From the web link collector page in the Salesforce integration, copy the code sample. This is the encryption code you’ll use in Salesforce. In Salesforce, create a custom field called SM_CV_ENCRYPTED_Data on the object that triggers your survey. For example, if your survey is sent when a Case is closed, place this custom field on the Case object. Make sure your encryption code references and places encrypted values in this field. In Salesforce , create an apex trigger that encrypts your custom variables when the event that triggers your survey occurs (for example, if your survey is sent when a Case is closed, make sure your trigger encrypts custom variables when this event happens). Or, paste the code sample from the Salesforce integration page and replace SM_ENCRYPTION_KEY with the encryption key your Primary Admin provided. IMPORTANT! If you want to use the code sample we provide, read the information on using the code below. Considerations For Using Sample Code We provide sample code for this trigger when you turn on encryption. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when using this code: Make sure to review the trigger and update it for your environment as needed. For example, you may want to update the trigger for the survey. This code only references the object you map your survey to (for example, if you map your survey to the Case object and then add mappings to the Account object, the sample code will only reference the Case object). If you map your survey to multiple objects, you’ll need to write custom code or update the sample to meet your needs. This code places encrypted data in the SM_CV_ENCRYPTED_Data field on your object. If you don’t have a field with this name on your object, the code won’t work. Send your Survey Set up any automations you need to send your survey link. If you’re sending this link from Salesforce, you’ll want to create an email template with your link, set up an email alert, and create a flow to send your survey.

Once you've mapped your survey to Salesforce , you can build custom reports and dashboards for the responses you’ve captured in Salesforce. Using Salesforce Dashboards There are many ways to report on survey response data within Salesforce. Once you’ve created reports, you can create Salesforce Dashboards based on those reports. You can edit, delete, and add new Reports and Dashboards within Salesforce as needed. Example : You want to create a dashboard for case closed surveys. You may want to plot a dashboard by agent, ticket type, and case reason. This can help you analyze NPS and CSAT scores across different variables in Salesforce. Applying Formulas to Data You can also use formula fields to categorize your data in reports. For example, if you map Net Promoter® Score (NPS) to Salesforce, you can create a formula to categorize scores as promoter, passive, or detractor. To do this: Add a formula field to the object you map NPS data to. Create a formula that categorizes the NPS scores: Score of 9 or 10 is categorized as Promoter Score of 7 or 8 is categorized as Passive Score of 6 or less is categorized as Detractor Score of 9 or 10 is categorized as Promoter Score of 7 or 8 is categorized as Passive Score of 6 or less is categorized as Detractor Learn more about tracking NPS in Salesforce . Or, use our sample formula to group NPS responses. The custom formula field on your object will translate the numerical score into a NPS category. You can then use the NPS data to create custom reports or dashboards that group responses by Promoter, Detractor, or Passive categories. SurveyMonkey Support can’t consult on coding issues.

Set up custom dashboards to share results with stakeholders. Customize the charts on your dashboard to share the most useful data with your colleagues. Example : Based on an age demographic question, you want to view how survey takers age 25+ impacted the results. Use compare rules to show the difference between 2 age groups. The charts will be split into each of those 2 age groups, so you can see how anyone over the age of 25 impacted the survey compared to anyone below the age of 25, all in one nice view Related Articles Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice"

Your custom response object should contain the following fields: Survey Name (Text) Contact (Lookup relationship – Contact) Email (Email) Net Promoter Score (Number) Comments (Long Text) NPS Response URL (Text, URL) NPS Grouping (Formula, result: Text) Promoter (Formula, result: Number) Passive (Formula, result: Number) Detractor (Formula, result: Number) Grouping NPS Responses On your custom object, add a formula field for NPS Grouping. NPS Grouping is a formula that categorizes survey takers as Promoters (9 & 10), Passives (7 & 8), or Detractors (6 & below) based on their Net Promoter Score. You can decide to display images or text in this field. For example, you can use stars, hearts, or other icons to help people quickly identify scores. Use one of the formulas below to use NPS Grouping on your object. NPS Grouping with Images Use this formula in your field to add images to each NPS grouping. You can replace the file path (for example, ""/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=015o0000001blTH"") with a different image. NPS Grouping without Images Use this formula to group NPS scores without using images. Totaling NPS Scores Add the Promoter, Passive, and Detractor fields to total the number of responses you’ve received for each NPS grouping. You need these grouping totals to calculate NPS in Salesforce. These fields don’t need to be visible on the page layout to add their totals together. Use these formulas to total the number of responses for each group: Promoter : IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 8, 1, 0) Passive : IF(AND(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 6, Net_Promoter_Score__c < 9), 1, 0) Detractor : IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c < 7, 1, 0) Creating a Custom Report Type for NPS Scores Create a custom report type in Salesforce for your NPS object. You’ll use this report to calculate your NPS score. Calculating NPS Scores To calculate NPS scores in Salesforce: Create a new Salesforce summary report using your NPS report type. You can choose to summarize NPS by Survey Name, or filter the report to only show specific Surveys. Write a summary formula in your report to calculate your score. The formula below is an example of an NPS calculation formula. Make sure to update the formula with the correct object name and field names based on how it’s been set up in your environment. We recommend selecting Grand Total Only when applying the formula. NPS Calculation Formula Mapping NPS Scores from SurveyMonkey to Salesforce Now that your Salesforce environment is ready, you can map your NPS survey into Salesforce. In SurveyMonkey, open the Salesforce integration , then map your response data to the corresponding Salesforce fields. For example, you can map the survey name, NPS score, and any comments to your custom Salesforce fields. When you've finished setting up mappings, you can start collecting responses.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is only available in English. If you use our Salesforce integration, you can measure customer satisfaction (CSAT) score and report on the results in Salesforce. Learn more about the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration . CSAT helps you understand a customer’s experience with a specific interaction or transaction, such as contacting support or making a purchase. You can use CSAT with other metrics to understand the full customer experience with your brand. The CSAT question looks like the example below: Overall, how would you rate your satisfaction with our company? Very Satisfied Somewhat Satisfied Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied Somewhat Dissatisfied Very Dissatisfied This guide helps you calculate and report your CSAT scores in Salesforce. Use these formulas to calculate the CSAT score from your surveys and build reports and dashboards in Salesforce. Calculating CSAT Scores Calculate CSAT as a percentage of satisfied responses (people who selected 4 or 5). Satisfied scores are a more accurate predictor of customer retention. To calculate CSAT score: Take the number of respondents who answered 4 and 5. Divide that number by the total number of survey responses. Multiply by 100 to see the percentage of satisfied customers. The formula for CSAT scores looks like this: (Number of satisfied customers (4 and 5) / Number of survey responses) x 100 = % of satisfied customers Example : 500 people responded to a CSAT survey. 68 were Very Satisfied (score 5), and 74 were Somewhat Satisfied (score 4). Add the number of Satisfied and Somewhat Satisfied responses to get 142. Divide 142 by the total number of responses (500). You get .284 . Multiply .284 by 100 to get 28.4%. This is your CSAT score. The equation would look like this: (142 / 500) x 100 = 28.4% Measuring CSAT with Salesforce You can track CSAT scores in Salesforce to include them in dashboards and reports. There are a few steps to complete to set up CSAT in Salesforce: Create your CSAT survey. (Optional) Create a survey object in Salesforce. Map your survey to the survey object. Send your survey to start collecting responses. Create a CSAT report in Salesforce with a summary formula. Create a CSAT Survey Create a survey with a 5-point scale question. There are 2 ways to build this question: Use a Matrix/Rating Scale question type, and select the checkbox to Make this a single-row rating scale . This will add weights to each answer option. Use a Multiple Choice question type and enable scoring. Your question should include the following answer choices: Very Satisfied (score = 5) Somewhat Satisfied (score = 4) Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied (score = 3) Somewhat Dissatisfied (score = 2) Very Dissatisfied (score = 1) You can also use a CSAT survey template to quickly build a CSAT survey. (optional) Create a Survey Object in Salesforce Create a custom object to hold CSAT responses from your survey. You’ll map survey responses to this object using the Salesforce integration. If you already have a survey object, make sure you have fields to hold your CSAT score (ex: 5) and the label (ex: Very Satisfied). When creating your survey object: Include a field for every survey question/answer you want to map to Salesforce. Use our field mapping guide to understand which field types you need to include on your object. Include a field for each custom variable in your survey. Set Up Mappings In the SurveyMonkey Salesforce integration, map your survey to your survey object in Salesforce. Use our field mapping guide to understand which field types you can map responses to. Send Your Survey When you finish creating mappings, send your survey using the methods available in the Salesforce integration. You can either: Create a weblink to send any way you want. Send an email from SurveyMonkey using a Salesforce outbound message. When someone takes your survey, their responses will be mapped to Salesforce. You can then create reports and dashboards to track CSAT in Salesforce. Create Salesforce Reports and Group Responses In SurveyMonkey, you can always view your responses in the Analyze Results section of your survey. Review question summaries, track data trends over time, or drill into individual responses . However, if you create reports in Salesforce, you can group customers by CSAT score. You can use this data to quickly find unsatisfied customers. SurveyMonkey can’t consult on coding issues in your Salesforce environment. Reach out to your Salesforce administrator for help implementing these formulas. These examples help you get started with our Salesforce integration, and you may need to make changes for your organization. To report on CSAT scores in Salesforce: Create a custom report type in Salesforce for your survey object. You’ll use this report to calculate your CSAT score. Create a new Salesforce summary report using your new report type. You can choose to summarize CSAT by Survey Name, or filter the report to only show specific Surveys. Write a summary formula in your report to calculate your score. The formula below is an example of a CSAT calculation formula. Make sure to update the formula with the correct object name and field names based on how it’s been set up in your environment. We recommend selecting Grand Total Only when applying the formula. Your survey respondents will be grouped by score on the report.

Navigating the Connect Apps tab Manage your Quick Actions Automate with Quick Actions in Connect Automate with Quick Actions in Connect Quick Actions What’s the difference between apps with quick actions and integrations? Navigating the Connect Apps tab Manage your Quick Actions The Connect apps section of your survey is the place to connect your survey data to your business apps to automate data sharing, collaborate smarter, and save time. Automating with quick actions helps to improve information sharing, iterate on survey feedback, and save time. Quick Actions Quick actions are simple automations that connect SurveyMonkey responses to popular business apps, like: Post notifications to Slack or Microsoft Teams to share targeted data with the right people, as responses roll in. Posting to these apps can help surface new ideas, channel feedback, or escalate something so teams can take action faster. Export responses to Excel or Google Sheets to share in-the-moment data with your team, which you can merge with other key data for deeper insights. Data selection and filtering When setting up quick actions, you can choose whether to act on all response data or target responses when a respondent selects a specific answer. Targeting the response data helps you channel the right survey data to the right people, making your quick action more relevant, usable, and efficient. What’s the difference between apps with quick actions and integrations? You can find all apps with quick actions in Connect apps , along with some integrations. The lightweight quick actions let you easily automate useful tasks, like creating notifications for visibility, further analysis, or prompt follow-up action. Setting up quick actions could improve your team’s collaboration and amplify your impact, all within SurveyMonkey. Only some integrations are accessible from Connect apps, but all integrations are available in the SurveyMonkey App Directory . You may need to install these integrations outside of SurveyMonkey. There are 200+ pre-built integrations helping you connect with popular CRMs, marketing automation tools, and BI platforms. Navigating the Connect Apps tab From the Connect apps Discover tab, search or browse the quick actions or explore some integration offerings. Select Manage to monitor or edit any quick actions you’ve already set up. Managing your Quick Actions Within the Connect apps space, you can manage and monitor all your actions, in one place.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is available in English only. If you use our SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration, you can set up a survey that gets sent to customers after someone closes a case in Salesforce. Learn more about the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration . Automate your survey distribution to collect timely customer feedback and take action. You can use the Salesforce integration to send CSAT surveys after a customer interacts with your support team. We'll use a CSAT survey in this example, but case closed workflows can work with other kinds of surveys, like Customer Effort Score (CES) or Net Promoter Score (NPS). Create Your Survey Create the survey you want to send when someone closes a case. Keep the following in mind: Start with a rating question, such as a Multiple Choice, Rating, or NPS question. To create a CSAT question, use a Multiple Choice or Matrix/Rating Scale question type with a 5-point scale. If you use a Multiple Choice question, enable scoring . If you use a Matrix/Rating Scale question, add weights to the answer choices . If you use a Multiple Choice question, enable scoring . If you use a Matrix/Rating Scale question, add weights to the answer choices . It's best to use 3-4 questions in your survey. (Optional) Create Custom Objects and Fields in Salesforce You can create a custom object in Salesforce to hold your survey responses. If you’re using our managed package or already have an object set up, skip this step. When creating your custom object: Custom objects typically have a lookup relationship with a standard object. Lookup relationships are like a parent/child relationship between your custom survey object and any other standard or custom object in Salesforce. For example, you can create a lookup relationship between the custom CSAT Survey object and the Case object. Create a custom field for each survey answer you’ll map to the object. For example: Create a number field to hold the CSAT score. Create a text field to hold an open-text answer. Create a text field to hold the label for your CSAT question. Create a number field to hold the CSAT score. Create a text field to hold an open-text answer. Create a text field to hold the label for your CSAT question. Set Up Salesforce Survey Mappings In SurveyMonkey, create survey mappings to push responses to your custom Salesforce object. You can either: Use our managed package , which creates an object and mappings for you. Create your own mappings to a custom object. To set up mappings: Open the Salesforce integration. Connect your survey to your Salesforce environment if you haven't already. Create your mappings. Learn more about creating mappings Once you save your mappings and send your survey, we push any new survey responses to the Salesforce object you chose. Add Custom Variables to Your Survey Add the Case ID variable to your survey link to relate survey responses with the case. You can also add custom variables for other data you want to track. Learn how to add custom variables to your survey link . Design an Email Template in Salesforce Your case closed email is the main piece of the Salesforce flow . When your support agent closes a case, the flow sends the survey to the case contact. There are a few ways to send a survey over email: Include your survey link in the body of a Salesforce email template in your outbound message. Create a SurveyMonkey Email Invitation and send your survey through Salesforce. Create a Case Closed Flow in Salesforce Once you create your email template in Salesforce, you can build the Salesforce flow. Use your outbound message in the flow to trigger your survey. Learn more about creating flows in Salesforce . Set Conditions for your Case Closed Survey If you send surveys after every case is closed, your customers may experience survey fatigue and stop responding to surveys. You can use conditions in your Salesforce flow to limit how often you send surveys. For example, you can send the survey in the following conditions: Only for a certain number of cases (Example: every 6th case closed). Only after a period of time (Example: if the survey taker hasn't submitted a response in 7 days). Only for Certain Number of Cases You might want to trigger a survey for a certain number of cases only (Ex: every 4th case). To do this, you'll need to use formulas and workflow rules in Salesforce. Add an auto-number field to the Case object to assign each case a numeric value. To do this, add an auto-number field to the Case object. This field assigns each case a numeric value of {0}. Adding an auto-number field assigns a whole number to each case. Use a Salesforce MOD formula to return the case number to 0 whenever it is divisible by 10. The end result will be a revolving set of numbers from 1-10 that resets to 0 whenever the case number hits 10. The screenshot below shows a formula set up for our environment. The Survey_Send_Number__C field is the auto-number field we set up earlier. The 6 is the number to divide by. In this case, every 6th case will receive a survey. Create a flow with a condition that sends the survey when that MOD formula equals 0 (which will only happen every 6th case). This will be our workflow rule criteria. Only After Certain Time Periods You can limit how often surveys are sent to individual respondents to only send a survey after someone hasn’t completed a survey for a certain time period. To do this, use custom mappings to map the Response Created Date or Response Modified Date attribute to Salesforce. The Completion Time attribute tells Salesforce when your recipient last completed a survey. Then, create a trigger in Salesforce to check the Completion Time before sending a survey. To only send surveys after a certain time period: In Salesforce, create a date field on the Contact object. In SurveyMonkey, go to the Salesforce integration. Create a custom mapping to map Response Create or Response Modified to the date field on the Contact object. In Salesforce, create a trigger to distribute the survey based on these rules. The trigger needs to do 3 actions: Check the date on the contact for the case in question If the date is more than a certain time period (ex: 7 days) before the current date, send the survey. Otherwise, do nothing. If there is no date at all, send the survey. Check the date on the contact for the case in question If the date is more than a certain time period (ex: 7 days) before the current date, send the survey. Otherwise, do nothing.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/integrations/marketo-integration/,Marketo Integration,"Marketo Integration Survey Requirements Connecting a Survey to Marketo Mapping Actions Options Query Mappings Field Mapping Managing Connected Surveys Marketo Integration Marketo Integration Survey Requirements Connecting a Survey to Marketo Mapping Actions Options Query Mappings Field Mapping Managing Connected Surveys Marketo Our Marketo integration lets you sync your SurveyMonkey response data with your leads in Marketo. You can use it to create or update leads in Marketo from contact information collected in SurveyMonkey, attach survey response data from SurveyMonkey to existing leads in Marketo, and trigger email campaigns based on certain response conditions. Get the integration! The Marketo integration is available as an add-on at an additional cost. Contact sales » Survey Requirements When you build your survey think about how it should map to your Marketo fields. For example: If you're mapping to a date field in Marketo, make sure that your survey includes a Date/Time question. If you want a survey to create new leads, make sure your survey includes questions like Name , Email address , Phone , or Address . Connecting a Survey to Marketo Once your survey and Marketo account are ready, follow these steps to link a survey to Marketo: Log in to SurveyMonkey. Click the grid icon in the top right corner and select Integrations & Plug-Ins . Click Marketo. Click Connect Survey . Choose your survey from the dropdown menu. Select a Mapping Action and review its options. If you're updating leads, create your Query Mappings . If you're using Marketo to send out your campaign, keep the SurveyMonkey Field Marketo Lead Id mapped to the Marketo Lead Field Id . If you're distributing the survey in another way, read more about Query Mappings . Select your Field Mapping , or how the response fields from your survey should map to each Marketo lead. Select or create a collector for the integration to use and click Save . Copy and paste the survey URL into your Marketo email or landing page template. Existing survey responses that were collected before connecting with Marketo will not populate in Marketo. Mapping Actions Options TIP! SurveyMonkey's custom activities let you create Smart Lists in Marketo to segment leads based on how they answered questions in your survey. When you create a Smart List, use the Survey Name, Question Name, and Question Response values from the Survey Answer activity to build your filter. For example, create a Smart List that filters for leads that answered a 9 or 10 to the Net Promoter Score question—making them a Promoter of your brand. Query Mappings SurveyMonkey uses your Query Mapping criteria to determine which lead to update. If you're using Marketo to send out your survey, leave the SurveyMonkey Field Marketo Lead Id mapped to the Marketo Lead Field Id . If you're distributing your survey in another way, you'll need to map a survey field to another field in Marketo that'll let the integration look up your leads by that field to figure out which one to update. For example, if you want to use an email address, select the SurveyMonkey question that collects an email address and map it to the Marketo field that stores it. Whatever you choose should be unique, if you have multiple leads with the same email address, you may want to map a second value to look leads up by, like, name. This way you can create a unique combination. Add more mappings to your lookup by clicking Add Field Mapping . If the integration comes up with more than one lead that matches your Query Mapping criteria, it'll log it in your Error Log. Field Mapping The Field Mappings table lets you map how the integration syncs the answers from your survey to your leads in Marketo. The Hidden Mappings table lets you map custom values to Marketo fields to be passed with each response—for example send a value describing or coding your survey's audience. When mapping fields remember that: The fields must match in data type, so a date field in Marketo should match a Date/Time question in SurveyMonkey and an email field in Marketo should match a question asking for an email address in SurveyMonkey. If you've turned on the option to overwrite existing data, a respondent leaving a mapped question blank could result in data loss. You can avoid this by making mapped questions required or setting a default value for the mapping. You can make a question required directly from the mapping page by clicking the yellow triangle icon next to the mapping. Any field you've set to be blocked in Marketo can't be overwritten, even if you've turned on the overwrite existing data option. Not all survey questions need to be mapped to a lead field. The responses to unmapped questions are available in Analyze and, if you're using the sync SurveyMonkey Answers option, in your lead's Action Log in Marketo. When you map to a boolean field in Marketo, it's set to True if any answer is selected or entered—you won't be able to determine what the answer is. Only map to a boolean field if you just want to capture if a particular optional question was answered or not. TIP! To create and map a Yes/No question, add a multiple choice question to your Survey, label your answer options Yes and No, and map these options to text fields in Marketo. To set a default value to pass if a question isn't answered: Click the Set default value icon (which looks like a pencil and paper) to the right of the mapped value you want to set a default for. Enter your desired value into the Default Value box. Click the Set default value icon (which looks like a pencil and paper) to the right of the mapped value you want to set a default for. Enter your desired value into the Default Value box. Managing Connected Surveys You can view and manage your connected surveys from the main page of the integration where they're listed in a table. TIP! Use the Audit Log to jump directly to a lead in Marketo by clicking Lead Id or jump directly to the response in Analyze by clicking Respondent Id .

We have two Google add-ons available: Use the SurveyMonkey for Google Sheets add-on to import your survey results directly into Google Sheets. Use the SurveyMonkey for Google Forms add-on to import your form into a SurveyMonkey survey. Google Sheets Add-On This add-on is available for SurveyMonkey paid plans . The Google Sheets add-on lets you import your survey responses to a spreadsheet. We’ll update your spreadsheets with new responses until you choose to stop importing. To import your survey results to Google Sheets: Get the free SurveyMonkey for Google Sheets add-on . You can find it in the SurveyMonkey App Directory or the Google Workspace Marketplace. Create a new spreadsheet in your Google account. Click Extensions from the toolbar. Select the SurveyMonkey add-on, then select Open . Select Get Started to log in with your SurveyMonkey details to authorize and open the app. The login page opens in a new browser tab. Once you log in, go back to your spreadsheet. Start Syncing Responses Once you sign in, you can start importing responses from SurveyMonkey. To import responses: Once your survey list pops up, select the survey you want to import results from. Check the boxes for the collectors you want to import results from. A green dot means the collector is open, and a gray dot means it's closed. Click Start importing to import the survey data. We create a new sheet with the same name as the survey you’re importing. We’ll also update your sheet with new responses any time you open the SurveyMonkey add-on. TIP! It’s best to stop importing responses before making changes to your spreadsheet. Spreadsheet Organization The add-on imports all responses from the collectors you selected into a sheet with the exact same name as the survey. The following information will help you get started analyzing the spreadsheet: Row 1 contains the question text from the survey. When a question isn't answered or is skipped by logic, the text ""Not Answered"" displays in the cell. The Checkbox question type lists each answer choice as it's own column and assigns True if the answer option was selected or False if it wasn’t. Questions with multiple rows, columns, or fields of answer choices span across multiple columns in the spreadsheet with each row, column, or field in its own column. The spreadsheet organizes respondents by row and includes the time the survey was submitted or last modified and the complete answer set for each respondent. For additional respondent metadata you may have included in an Email Invitation Collector, please download an All Responses Data XLS export . Filtering Your Spreadsheet You can create filters in Google Sheets to organize the results, but it's best to wait to edit the spreadsheet until you're done refreshing the results—refreshing may overwrite changes you've made to the sheet. Refreshing Your Data To refresh the available surveys or response counts per collector, click the refresh button at the top of the list to the right of your SurveyMonkey username. To import new responses to the sheet, close and reopen the SurveyMonkey add-on. We’ll update your spreadsheet with new responses.

Importing Data to a New Sheet You can import the survey data into a new sheet (or tab) within the spreadsheet if you don't want to overwrite any changes you've made. You have two options: Edit the name of the sheet (the tab within the spreadsheet—not the name of the spreadsheet itself), then click Import to the right of the survey title. A new sheet will be created within the spreadsheet. Edit the survey title in SurveyMonkey, then click Import to the right of the survey title. A new sheet will be created with the updated survey title. Stop Importing Responses Stop importing responses to change which collectors you import responses from or make changes to your sheet. To stop importing new responses: From the SurveyMonkey extension, select the survey you want to stop importing responses from. Click Stop importing to the right of the survey title. If you want to keep importing responses later, just select Start importing . If you start importing again, any changes made to the spreadsheet will be lost. To keep any changes you made, rename your tab before you start importing responses again. Limitations Google Sheets allows us to import up to 3,000 responses at a time. To view more responses in a sheet, consider exporting your results to an XLS or CSV file. If your survey has a lot of questions or responses, please refer to Google's spreadsheet size limits . We support the new version of Google Sheets, which has a limit of 2 million cells per spreadsheet. A/B Test responses can’t be imported. Google Forms Add-On This add-on is available for all SurveyMonkey plan types, including the free plan. The Google Forms add-on lets you convert a Google Form to a survey in SurveyMonkey. You can then design and send your survey from SurveyMonkey. To import your Google Form into a survey: Get the free SurveyMonkey for Google Forms add-on . Open your Google Form. Click Add-ons from the toolbar. Open the SurveyMonkey add-on. You'll need to log in with your SurveyMonkey details to authorize and open the app. Once the app window pops up, select the form questions you want to include in your survey.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). The integration setup is only available in English. With SurveyMonkey for Salesforce, you can build automations to trigger surveys and push data back to Salesforce records for in-context analysis. Create reports, dashboards, and automate flows to take action on feedback. This guide helps you get ready to send survey data to Salesforce. Follow the steps below to get started. Then, read our guide, Using SurveyMonkey for Salesforce , to create your mappings and send your survey. Before You Start Make sure you have the Salesforce and SurveyMonkey permissions you need to set up the integration. All your mappings are saved to the Salesforce account you connect to. You can connect to multiple Salesforce accounts, including your sandbox environment. If possible, use an integration-specific Salesforce account . If the logged-in Salesforce account is deactivated, their mappings will stop working. SurveyMonkey Permissions If your SurveyMonkey plan has Power and Casual seats , you need an Enterprise Power seat to access the integration. Salesforce Permissions In Salesforce, you can use the Salesforce Integration license with the SurveyMonkey integration. However, you'll need to enable certain permissions first. The table below lists the recommended permissions for your Salesforce profile. Step 1: SurveyMonkey Setup There are a few steps to take in SurveyMonkey before you start mapping responses to Salesforce. Build the survey you want to connect to Salesforce. Add questions , apply logic , and customize the design . Learn more about creating your survey . (Optional) Add custom variables to track information about survey takers. You can include a Salesforce merge field to pull in known data from Salesforce. You can also add custom variables later when you create your mappings. (Optional) If you want to send your survey via email invitation, create your email message now. Select ""resume later"" when you finish creating your email message to save it as a template. Step 2: Salesforce Object Setup If you’re sending data to a standard or custom Salesforce object, make sure to set it up before pushing survey data to Salesforce. This applies to new and existing objects. TIP! You may need help from your Salesforce administrator to set up your object. To set up your object: If necessary, build a custom object to map your surveys to. You don’t need to do this if you’re mapping to an existing object. Add custom fields to hold survey data . If necessary, add custom fields for each piece of information in your survey you want to store in this object. Make sure you can write to these fields – SurveyMonkey can’t push data to read-only fields. Some survey questions can only be mapped to certain field types in Salesforce. Use our field mapping guide to make sure you add the right fields for your survey data. Make sure you can write to these fields – SurveyMonkey can’t push data to read-only fields. Some survey questions can only be mapped to certain field types in Salesforce. Use our field mapping guide to make sure you add the right fields for your survey data. Add lookup fields . Lookup relationships allow you to associate data from this object to another one, such as the Contact object. You’ll need to include the record ID (such as the Contact ID) in your survey responses when you send your survey. Step 3: Connect to Salesforce and Create Mappings Connect your Salesforce account to the integration so you can create your mappings. You can connect multiple accounts, including sandbox environments. This process leverages OAuth 2.0 for a secure integration. To access the integration: In SurveyMonkey, select the Products icon and select Integrations & Plug-ins . Select Salesforce . Select Connect or Connect Sandbox to connect your Salesforce account. If you’ve signed in to Salesforce, we’ll automatically connect to your signed-in account. You can repeat these steps to connect more Salesforce accounts. Go to our SurveyMonkey for Salesforce guide when you're ready to create your mappings. How Mapping Works Mappings send your survey data back to Salesforce. You can map specific responses or metadata to fields on Salesforce objects. You can choose from two mapping types: Managed package : If you don't need customization, you can send all responses to the SurveyMonkey Response object. You'll need to install a small package in Salesforce. This option creates the mapping for you. Learn more about our managed package for Salesforce . Custom object mapping : Build your own mappings to send data to custom or standard Salesforce objects. This requires more effort but lets you control where your survey data is sent in Salesforce. Use our field mapping guide to learn which Salesforce fields you can send survey data to. Learn more about mapping types , or learn how to create mappings . Step 4: Send Your Survey Once you create your mappings, you can send your survey. The Salesforce integration gives you 2 deployment options: A Web link , which you can copy and paste into another email. This option is best if you want to send your survey from an existing email template in Salesforce. You can include custom variables in your web link to gather more data about your respondents. An Email Invitation , which sends from SurveyMonkey. You can personalize your SurveyMonkey email with data from Salesforce. We'll help you create an Outbound Message in Salesforce. Then, you'll need to create a Salesforce flow to send your survey. Learn how to use the Salesforce integration deployment options . Optional: Salesforce Lightning Flows and Components SurveyMonkey offers a few features for customers using Lightning Experience : Lightning flow : Lets Salesforce users take or send in-the-moment surveys directly from Account, Contact, or Lead objects. Salesforce users can take a survey within Salesforce, for example, to provide feedback that a customer gave a rep over the phone. SurveyMonkey Lightning component : Lets Salesforce users send a survey to one or more Contacts off any object. Survey Response Visualization Lightning component : Lets you see the responses from the survey that were completed via the Lightning component or flow. Learn more . Ways to Use the Integration You can chat with your CSM about your specific use case so you can best utilize the integration. Organizations use the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration in many different ways, depending on how they use Salesforce. Below are some common use cases.

View Shared Mappings To view the team's shared mappings, hover over the down arrow next to Connected Accounts or My Mappings and select Shared Mappings . Team members can Edit Shared Mappings but can't view the deployment options page. To get the invitation URL, team members can contact the survey owner. Copy Mappings to Another Account If you build mappings in a Sandbox account, you can copy them over to a production account. To copy mappings: If you haven't already, add a connection for your other Salesforce account. On the My Mappings page, check the box for the survey you want to copy. Select Copy to Account . Select the account to copy your mapping to. Select OK . Common Questions How do I tie my responses to a specific record in Salesforce? First, check that you included Custom Variables in your survey mapping —either your survey field mapping or query mapping, depending on your mapping action. If your variables are mapped, the merge fields in your survey URL may need to be updated if your sending platform's {Merge field} differs from Salesforce. For example, Pardot uses different merge fields than Salesforce. Check the {Merge field} in the survey URL and replace it with the correct merge field from your sending platform.

No—only responses that you collect after the integration is connected can be mapped to Salesforce. No—only responses that you collect after the integration is connected can be mapped to Salesforce. How do we keep the responses sync active if the user that set up the mappings leaves the company? Don't delete a SurveyMonkey account or a Salesforce connection with an active Salesforce mapping, as this deletes the mappings permanently and survey data won't sync to Salesforce. Instead, if necessary, first reassign the SurveyMonkey account—this maintains all survey and integration data in the account. If the Salesforce connection a mapping is set up under will be deactivated, to avoid data loss, copy the mappings over to a new Salesforce connection/account. To copy mappings over to a new Salesforce account: Add a new Salesforce connection by logging into Salesforce and selecting Add account on the integration page (the Salesforce user you are logged in as will be added). Go to Connected Accounts and select the username of the original Salesforce connection. Select survey mappings and Copy to Account . Select the new Salesforce connection. The survey mappings are copied to the new connection. This doesn't include the sync data for original mapping. You can now safely delete the original Salesforce connection or deactivate the user.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/integrations/salesforce-map-multiple-surveys/,SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Salesforce Object,"SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Salesforce Object Build Page Layouts Create Record Types Map to a Record Type in SurveyMonkey SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Salesforce Object SurveyMonkey for Salesforce: Mapping Multiple Surveys to a Custom Salesforce Object Build Page Layouts Create Record Types Map to a Record Type in SurveyMonkey Get the integration ! SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is only available in English. The SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration allows you to map survey data to fields on Salesforce objects. However, if you map multiple surveys to the same custom object, you may end up with blank fields and missing information. You can adjust your object’s page layout to make sure your data displays correctly. To organize a custom object, you can create Record Types in Salesforce. Record types are like mini page layouts, where certain fields can be hidden from view depending on the chosen layout. For this example, we'll map 3 surveys into the same custom object. These surveys will be called “Customer Service Feedback,” “Trip Feedback,” and “Case Closure.” Build Page Layouts First, you’ll need to create a few page layouts in Salesforce for your custom object. You'll use these page layouts to create record types later. Create the following page layouts: A “primary layout” that includes every field you’ve added. A separate layout for each survey you’re mapping to the object. Each layout should contain only the fields you’re mapping that survey to. In this example, we create 4 page layouts: a primary layout, a Customer Service Feedback layout, a Trip Feedback layout, and a Case Closure layout. Create Record Types After creating your page layouts, create a record type for each page layout. From Setup in Salesforce, go to your object, then select Record Types . Follow this guidance when creating the record types: You’ll need to select an existing record type to create a new one. If you don’t have any, you can use the Master type. Make the record type available for any profile that has access to your survey data. You don’t have to check the Active box yet, but the layouts won’t work until you activate them. On the second page, select the page layout to use for your record type. Repeat the process to create a record type for each page layout you created. Map to a Record Type in SurveyMonkey Finally, map responses from your survey to the appropriate record types in Salesforce. To choose record types in SurveyMonkey: Go to the Salesforce Integration . Connect your account and survey if you haven't already. Create a new mapping . Map all of your responses to the custom object. Under Add more data , map the record type ID to the Record Type ID field as a static value. Select Save object to save your mapping. Repeat for each survey you’re mapping to the custom object. Once you create your mappings, submit a few test survey responses to make sure the responses display correctly in your Record Types.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/solutions/audience-custom-balancing/,SurveyMonkey Audience Custom Balancing,"SurveyMonkey Audience Custom Balancing SurveyMonkey Audience Custom Balancing SurveyMonkey Audience Custom Balancing Custom balancing lets you choose the breakdown of your responses in a SurveyMonkey Audience project. When you're getting responses from our Contribute, Rewards, or Global panel, you can use custom balancing to choose the distribution of completed responses you want from each gender or age group you're targeting. For example, get 80% of your completed responses from female respondents and 20% from male respondents. To use custom balancing: Create a Targeted Audience collector. Under Basic Demographics, click Age or Gender . Choose the Custom option. Any previously selected age or gender criteria is removed so you can use the custom balancing tool. For Gender , use the slider scale to pick the percentage of responses you want from males and females. For Age , click Edit and enter the minimum and maximum age range for each group you're looking to survey. You can target 2–8 different age groups. Next enter the percentage of complete responses you want from each group (the percentages must total 100%). Each age range should be 5 years or more (18–23 works, but 18–21 doesn't), and age groups can't overlap (you can't have both 18-30 and 25-35 as age groups). Click Save once you're done. Take a look at your Project Details on the right side of the page to review your custom balancing selections and the additional cost per response. TIP! Custom balancing restricts the pool of available people to take your survey, so you may have to buy a larger number of completed responses than you need. The exact number is variable and depends on: the number of age group, the size of each age group, the percentage of responses for each age group, and any custom gender balancing. Completed Responses Due to the nature of the system, the variability of response rates, and natural margin of error, we can't guarantee that you'll get the exact number of completed responses that you specified per gender and age. There's a fault tolerance of ±5 responses per gender group and age group. Read more about completed responses . Using Both Age and Gender Balancing You can use both custom age and gender balancing at the same time. When you do that, we combine the percentage of both gender and age balancing to determine the distribution of responses from each gender against each age group. Let's say you're buying 500 completed responses and choose the following custom gender and age balancing settings: Gender : Female 75%, Male 25% Age : 18–29: 30%, When you do that, we combine the percentage of both gender and age balancing to determine the number of completed responses your project will receive: 70% With these custom gender and age balancing options, the system calculates how many responses each gender + age group will get like this: Completed Responses (500) * Female Responses (75%) * 18-29 Age Group (30%) = 113 responses Completed Responses (500) * Female Responses (75%) * 30–39 Age Group (70%) = 263 responses Completed Responses (500) * Male Responses (25%) * 18-29 Age Group (30%) = 38 responses Completed Responses (500) * Male Responses (25%) * 30–39 Age Group (70%) = 88 responses Related Articles Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice"

Estimating qualification rate / incidence rate If your survey has a screening question with disqualification logic, you need to select a qualification rate before completing your order. The qualification rate is the estimated percentage of people you expect to qualify for your survey based on your screening questions. Your qualification rate affects the number of people we send your survey to. Learn more It's important to do independent research to estimate your qualification rate. There are a few tips you can use: Check your company's market research data . Many companies already know roughly what to expect. Try asking colleagues if they know who would have access to data like this. Do some quick research online . If you're targeting a well-researched population, there may be industry evidence documented online. Run a small test project . You can get a better idea (within a margin of error of +/- 10%) of the qualification rate by surveying just 100 people. This strategy works best if you plan on buying a larger sample and don't mind spending a smaller amount to get a better idea of what your qualification rate might be. It's better to estimate a lower qualification rate than you expect to improve the chances of getting the number of complete responses you need.

How to Analyze Your Data Idea Screening provides you with instant insights and automated analysis capabilities. Scorecards show statistical significance and compile results in a single visual. AI-powered insights surface which ideas scored best, or worst with different groups of respondents. Also, presentation-ready PowerPoint exports make sharing your findings easy. Viewing Survey Responses You can view a comparison of your survey results or browse through individual responses. Comparison Viewing Comparison, the default Analyze view, gives you an overview of the Summary Scorecard and each Attribute. Comparison What You See Summary Scorecard A breakdown showing how each of your stimuli scored by attribute. Boxes in blue are rated with the most statistical significance and the letters show which ideas we identify significance over. Use the drop-down menu to change between your top two and bottom two box scores. Attribute Scorecard Displays the top two and bottom two scores associated with each answer choice for each question. Boxes in blue are rated with most confidence. Open-ended responses show as a word cloud. Use the drop-down menu to sort through each stimulus. Select Modify Range to change the total number of words in the cloud. You may notice the number of respondents viewing each stimulus may vary. Idea screening uses block randomization so variation is expected. Statistical Significance Idea screening uses the McNemar's test, which is a method for calculating statistical significance based on respondent's seeing multiple stimuli. A statistically significant difference tells you whether one group's answers are substantially different from another group's answers by using statistical testing. Statistical significance means that the numbers are reliably different, greatly aiding your data analysis. You should consider whether the results are important, as it's up to you to decide how to interpret or take action on your results. Confidence Level The confidence level is the likelihood that your sample audience accurately reflects the attitudes of the group you selected. SurveyMonkey recommends a confidence level of 95%, which is most commonly used. Change the confidence level on the top right of the Analysis page. Comparison and Custom Question Data If you included comparison or custom questions in your survey, your data appears below the Summary Scorecard.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/solutions/response-rate/,Response Rate,"Response Rate Response Rate Response Rate Your response rate is the percentage of people who respond to your survey. To calculate the response rate percentage for your survey, use the following equation: You can find the total number of responses in the Analyze Results section of your survey. To calculate your response rate based on the number of complete responses to your survey, filter by completeness and select Complete responses . The number of complete responses appears at the top of the page when the filter is applied. TIP! Learn how to calculate the number of respondents you need or use our sample size calculator . Improving Your Response Rate If a large number of respondents don't respond to your survey, or they exit or abandon your survey before completing it, you'll have a low response rate. In general, you can expect a low response rate if your survey is long, your survey language is complicated, or you send your survey to the wrong audience. Read our tips to ensure you're doing all you can to get the best response rate possible. Clean Up Your Survey Design The length and tone of your survey dramatically impact your response rate. If survey is long and your questions are text heavy, respondents can feel overwhelmed and exit your survey. Keep these tips in mind when designing your survey: Keep your survey short—include only the essential questions and answer options. Attention and motivation tend to drop as a survey goes on. Use the fewest, shortest words possible to say what you mean. The less respondents have to read, the better. Keep your language simple. Aim for a vocabulary you think a young adult would understand and don't use jargon. Let respondents skip open-ended questions—don't require open-ended questions. Respondents who don't want to take the time to write a response might exit the survey instead of writing a response. The length and tone of your survey dramatically impact your response rate.

If someone is uninterested, they may exit your survey and lower your response rate. You can add a qualifying question to your survey to ensure you're surveying the right people. Add Skip Logic to your survey to skip people past questions or pages that may not apply to them. If you're using SurveyMonkey Audience to buy survey responses, read our targeting tips .

Keep Contacts Up to Date If you know your survey audience personally, let people know that you're planning to conduct a survey, what it's about, and when to expect it. If you're sending your survey to a list of contacts, either by Email Invitation or through another messaging platform, make sure your contact list is up to date. If your contact list is out of date, you may be missing important contacts whose email addresses have changed, and your messages could bounce.

Personalize Email Invitations and Send Reminders Make sure your survey invitations are inviting—keep them short, simple, and approachable. Provide a brief introduction about what your survey is about, and how long it will take. If you need to include detailed information, like a privacy notice, consent statement , or survey instructions, include it in a survey introduction instead of your invitation. If you're sending your survey via Email Invitation , personalize invitations and reminders by including the name of your respondents using custom data tags in your message.

Get started now , or explore our other market research solutions . This solution is available for US Data Center accounts only. The Web Link collector is available on Advantage, Premier, and Enterprise plans . The MaxDiff solution helps you understand what items or features matter most to your audience. This is helpful when you’re prioritizing new products or features and want to know what your customers care about most. The solution is based on MaxDiff methodology. We create your survey questions using the items you enter. You don’t have to create each MaxDiff question yourself – you enter the items you want to include in your survey, and we create the questions. How MaxDiff Works (Experimental Design) The MaxDiff solution builds your survey questions using the items you enter. You don’t have to create each MaxDiff question yourself – you enter the items you want to include in your survey, and we create the questions. MaxDiff is not a predictive model. It uses algorithmic predictions to estimate outcomes based on multiple-choice scenarios. We recommend that you provide your own notices about these tools to your respondents. Expand the dropdown to learn more about the experimental design. MaxDiff experimental design In a MaxDiff study, respondents should see each item about the same number of times as the other items. SurveyMonkey’s MaxDiff solution creates 30 versions of the survey and distributes them randomly to survey takers to achieve the most bias-free results. However, you can choose how many items are included in each set and how many questions each respondent sees. We consider the following metrics when creating the different versions of your survey. These metrics ensure that your items are represented fairly to reduce bias in your results. One-way Frequencies : Each item should ideally appear an equal number of times to the respondent as they take the survey. Two-way Frequencies : Each item should ideally appear in the same set with each other item an equal number of times. Connectivity : Each item should directly or indirectly be shown with every other item across the 30 versions of the survey. Within-set positional balancing : Each item should ideally appear an equal number of times in the top, middle, and bottom of the question when shown to respondents. Across-set positional balancing : The same item shouldn’t be shown in successive or nearby questions.

Once you submit payment, we'll start gathering responses for your survey right away. Analyzing Results Select the chart icon on the left side of the screen to start analyzing your results. In the Analyze section, there’s an Overview, Counts, Empirical Bayes, Survey results, and Individual Responses. Overview : Track your Audience project's status, view how many responses are collected, and see a summary of your targeting criteria. Counts : Get a simple view of how often items were chosen as Best or Worst. Empirical Bayes : Learn how each item performed compared to others. TURF : Review item combinations that are likely to appeal to your target audience. Survey results : View charts and data for your custom questions. Individual responses : View each survey taker’s response. Counts Analysis Counts analysis shows you how often items were chosen as Best or Worst. This data helps you quickly understand how survey takers rated each item. You can view a few different data sets in the chart: Simple counts, Best counts, Worst counts, or Best and Worst counts. Simple counts : Total Best ratings for an item minus Worst ratings. Best counts : How many times an item was chosen as Best. Worst counts : How many times an item was chosen as Worst. Best and Worst counts : Compare how many times an item was chosen as Best and Worst. View all data for each item in the table below your chart. The table also includes Count proportion , which is the quantity of Best or Worst counts divided by the number of times people saw the item. Empirical Bayes Analysis Empirical Bayes shows how survey takers feel about each item. It estimates each item's likelihood of being chosen as Best, relative to other items. Empirical Bayes calculates a utility score for each item, which is a measure of how well an item performed. We calculate this score across all sets and survey takers. We use the following data to calculate utility score for each item: Number of times chosen as Best Number of times chosen as Worst Number of times shown ​​First, we combine all responses to find the utility score for each item. Then, we calculate an item's utility value for each respondent. If someone didn't see all items, we use Bayesian Pooling (or ""Shrinkage"") to estimate how someone would have responded to the item. We assume that they would answer similarly to the aggregate score, since it combines all responses. We ""shrink"" the survey taker's utility value toward the aggregate score for the item they didn't see. These scores help us estimate how likely it is that an item will be chosen as Best. The chart shows the utility score for each item. A higher score means that an item is more likely to be chosen as Best and may be more important to your target audience. Using Empirical Bayes Select a scale in the top right corner to change how you view the data: Probability-scaled : Shows the likelihood that people will choose an item as Best. We show each utility score as a percentage. The highest scoring item is most likely to be chosen as best. The scores add up to 100. Zero-centered : Adjusts the scale to use 0 as the average score. A positive score means the item performed better than average. A negative score means the item performed worse than average. Raw scores : View the raw utility scores for each item. Raw scores reflect the actual choices people made during the survey. Raw scores are not probabilities. The table below the chart shows each item’s score and the 95% confidence interval. The confidence interval is a range of scores that contains the score we'd see a certain percentage of times if we did the survey over and over. For example, an item has a 95% confidence interval of [13–14]. In other words, the item would score between 13 and 14 in 95 out of 100 repetitions of the survey. TURF Analysis TURF stands for Total Unduplicated Reach and Frequency. It's a technique that can help you understand how different groups of products or features appeal to audiences. Our MaxDiff TURF analysis tool simulates item combinations that are likely to appeal to your target audience. Use this data to prioritize products or features that will reach the most people. Our TURF analysis tool ranks combinations based on two key metrics: reach and frequency . Reach : the percentage of respondents with at least 1 appealing item in the combination. A “reached” respondent has an appealing item in the combination. A combination with high reach has a mix of items that appeal to the most people. Frequency : the average number of items in the combination that respondents found appealing. Frequency will always be a number between 1 and 2. Higher frequency means that a combination’s items were more popular. Using TURF Analysis Use the Items and Items per combination dropdowns to simulate different combinations. Consider simulating multiple combination sizes to learn how different items impact reach and frequency. Filtering Results On any page, select the Filters button above the chart to filter your data. Any filters you apply to one chart will also apply to others. For example, if you add an Age filter to your Counts analysis, we’ll also apply it to your Empirical Bayes analysis.

This could prevent them from completing your survey. Add page breaks between each piece of logic. Logic is triggered when people click the Next button on a survey page. Check whether you have both page and question logic applied on the same page. Question logic overrides page logic, and Advanced Branching rules work a bit differently. If you use screening questions, make sure to skip people to a Disqualification Page . Avoid sending people to the End of Survey as these responses will count towards your complete responses. You can test your survey logic when you preview your survey to make sure everything's working as expected.

Recommended Best Practices While these guidelines aren't required, we've found that surveys that follow them are more likely to be engaging and get higher response rates. Establish a clear goal for your survey A survey with one survey goal and only a few subtopics can streamline the survey creation process and simplify the analysis phase. A survey with one survey goal and only a few subtopics can streamline the survey creation process and simplify the analysis phase. Limit Matrix/Rating Scale, Ranking, and open-ended questions We suggest using a variety of question types , but avoid using too many open-ended questions like Textboxes and Comment Boxes . Limit open-ended questions to 3-5 per survey. Avoid Ranking questions, and limit the use of Matrix/Rating Scale and Matrix of Dropdown Menu questions. If you do use Matrix questions, use a maximum of 5 Matrix questions per survey with no more than 5 columns and 5 rows per question. Consider breaking matrix rows into individual Multiple Choice questions. Each row in Matrix/Rating Scale or Matrix of Dropdown Menu question counts as one question.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/solutions/calculating-respondents/,Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need,"Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need Calculating the Number of Respondents You Need The number of respondents you need depends on your survey goals and how confident you want to be in your results. The more confident you want to be, the less of a margin of error you should accept. To calculate the number of respondents you need (known as your sample size), use our sample size calculator . TIP! If you need a guaranteed number of respondents, buy survey responses from SurveyMonkey Audience. You specify the number of responses you need and we'll use your targeting criteria to find you respondents. Definitions To calculate your sample size, you'll need to know the following information: Population Size Your population size is the size of the entire population you wish to represent. Population : The entire group you're interested in making conclusions about. Sample : The group you're surveying. Think about the potential size of your target population. For example, if you're sending a survey to male iPhone users in California, you may need to do some research to determine how many total men fit that criteria. Your population size is the size of the entire population you wish to represent. Population : The entire group you're interested in making conclusions about. Sample : The group you're surveying. Think about the potential size of your target population. For example, if you're sending a survey to male iPhone users in California, you may need to do some research to determine how many total men fit that criteria. Margin of Error Margin of error tells you how much error surrounds a measure. It's a percentage that describes how much the opinions and behavior of the sample you survey is likely to deviate from the total population. To calculate your margin of error, use our margin of error calculator . The smaller the margin of error is, the closer you are to having the exact answer at a given confidence level. In general, the larger your sample size, the lower the margin of error. The closer your sample is in size to your population, the more representative your results are likely to be. And that’s why you’ll notice that the recommended sample size in the table below gets smaller as your tolerance for error gets larger. For example, let's say we asked 400 people if they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Barack Obama and 55% say favorable. Using a 95% confidence level and ±5% margin of error, if we repeated this survey 100 times under the same conditions, 95 out of 100 times, the response would be somewhere between 50% and 60%.

Confidence Level A confidence level tells you how reliable a measure is. Common standards used by researchers are 90%, 95%, and 99%. A 95% confidence level means if the same survey were to be repeated 100 times under the same conditions, 95 times out of 100 the measure would lie somewhere within the margin of error. When calculating your sample size, you'll use the z-score for your confidence level. The z-score is the number of standard deviations a given proportion is away from the mean. Confidence Level z-score 90% 1.65 95% 1.96 99% 2.58 A confidence level tells you how reliable a measure is. Common standards used by researchers are 90%, 95%, and 99%.

When calculating your sample size, you'll use the z-score for your confidence level. The z-score is the number of standard deviations a given proportion is away from the mean. Percentage Value Sample size requirements vary based on the percentage of your sample that picks a particular answer. For example, if in a previous survey you found that 75% of your customers said yes they are satisfied with your product and you are looking to conduct that survey again, you can use p = 0.75 to calculate your needed sample size. If you're running a survey for the first time, and since most surveys have more than one question (and therefore more than one percentage value to evaluate), we recommend using p = 0.5 to calculate your optimum sample size. This produces a sample size estimate that is neither too conservative nor too loose. Sample size requirements vary based on the percentage of your sample that picks a particular answer.

This produces a sample size estimate that is neither too conservative nor too loose. Calculating Sample Size Calculate the number of respondents you need in seconds using our sample size calculator . If you’d like to do the sample size calculation by hand, use the following formula: Suggested Sample Sizes Below is a table with suggested population sizes by margin of error at a 95% confidence level. We used the above formula to calculate the suggested sample sizes. In some cases, we rounded the sample sizes up to the nearest 5 or 10. For a more exact calculation, use our sample size calculator . Example Sample Size You're sending a survey with a Yes or No question asking if parents of children at your school are in favor of an extended school day. The total number of parents (your population size) is 10,000 and you're comfortable with a ±10% margin of error. Using the table above, you can see you'll need at least 100 people to take your survey. 70% of the 100 parents surveyed answered that they are in favor of an extended school day. This means you can assume that if all 10,000 parents answered the survey, between 60% to 80% of people would be in favor of an extended school day. How many people should I ask to take my survey? Your response rate may affect the number of people you send your survey to. The higher the response rate, the fewer people you need to ask to take your survey. For example, if you need 100 respondents and you expect 25% of the people invited to take your survey will actually respond, then you need to invite 400 people to take your survey. To calculate the number of people you need to invite to take your survey based on your expected response rate, use the following equation: Respondents needed Take the number of people you need to answer your survey ÷ Response rate Divide by the expected response rate (use 25 for 25%, if you use .25 skip step 3) x 100 Then multiply by 100 (to account for the using a percentage versus a decimal in step 2) Related Articles Company SurveyMonkey About Us Jobs Blog Help SurveyMonkey Help GetFeedback Help Market Research Help SurveyMonkey Audience Help SurveyMonkey Contribute Help Wufoo Help Apply Help Support Site Status Unsubscribe Contact Us Email Opt-In Policies Legal Center Privacy Policy Cookies Notice California Privacy Notice"

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/solutions/audience-additional-settings/,SurveyMonkey Audience: Additional Targeting Settings,"SurveyMonkey Audience: Additional Targeting Settings Custom Screening Questions Schedule for Later Exclusions SurveyMonkey Audience: Additional Targeting Settings SurveyMonkey Audience: Additional Targeting Settings Custom Screening Questions Schedule for Later Exclusions When buying responses with SurveyMonkey Audience , you can customize your project and targeting to meet your needs. There are a few additional settings you can use: Custom screening questions: Make your target audience even more specific by adding up to 3 screener questions. Schedule for later: Schedule your survey’s launch up to a month in advance. Exclusions: Prevent respondents who have taken other surveys you’ve created in the past 100 days from participating. Not sure where to start? Learn how to buy responses with SurveyMonkey Audience . Custom Screening Questions Make your target audience even more specific by adding up to 3 screener questions. This will require even more responses to reach your goal. For example, you want to target people with small dogs . You choose “owns a dog” in your targeting criteria when setting up your SurveyMonkey Audience project. In your survey design, you can include the following screening question: How large is your dog? Small Medium Large Small Medium Large Respondents that choose “small” should be allowed to continue the survey, while respondents who choose “medium” or “large” should be disqualified, since they don’t meet the criteria for your survey. To add custom screening questions: Go to the Optional settings section. Toggle on the Custom screening questions option. Make sure you’ve added a question to the beginning of your survey. We recommend Multiple Choice or Checkboxes. Choose the percentage of people you expect to qualify for your survey based on your screening questions. This is called the Qualification Rate. Schedule for Later Select a date and time to collect responses for your chosen audience. This can help you target respondents in a different time zone or send your survey after a specific event occurs. You can choose a date and time up to a month in the future. On the date you select, we’ll send your survey to your target audience. The scheduled time is based on the time zone set in your SurveyMonkey account. To schedule your survey’s launch: Go to the Optional settings section. Toggle on the Schedule for later option. Choose the date and time you want to send your survey. Exclusions Exclusions help you collect new responses from different panelists if you’re relaunching your survey. Here are two ways to exclude previous panelists from taking your survey. Exclusions for the Same Survey When you relaunch a survey via SurveyMonkey Audience, we automatically exclude any panelists who took this survey in the past. Simply create a new Audience collector for the same survey to apply the exclusions. Here’s how it works. Let's say you send survey A for the first time. If you send survey A again one month later, we automatically exclude panelists who previously took survey A . This way, you get a new set of responses. Exclusions for a Different Survey Exclude duplicate panelists from taking different surveys that you’ve previously sent. For example, you create survey B and need a new set of panelists. Before sending survey B , use the Exclusions option on the Audience calculator page and select survey A from the dropdown menu. Any panelists who took survey A will not be sent survey B . To exclude respondents from surveys you've sent via SurveyMonkey Audience: Toggle on the Exclusions option. Select the surveys that you need excluded. TIP! If your survey was sent more than 100 days ago, it won't be displayed in the exclusions dropdown menu. Contact us to apply survey exclusions on your behalf, and then provide us the following information: - Title of the survey you need to send. - Targeting criteria for the new survey. - Title of the surveys you sent before—we’ll prevent panelists who took this survey from taking your new survey.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/solutions/target-audience/,How to Reach a Target Audience,"How to Reach a Target Audience Getting Started Targeting-Options Screening & Disqualification Qualification Rate How to Reach a Target Audience How to Reach a Target Audience Getting Started Targeting-Options Screening & Disqualification Qualification Rate Getting Started When you buy survey responses with SurveyMonkey Audience , there are two great ways to make sure the right people take your survey: 1. Choose targeting options in a Target Audience collector. 2. Add screening questions with disqualification logic to your survey, and estimate a qualification rate. ADD-ON PURCHASE: SurveyMonkey Audience responses are purchased separately from your plan subscription as a one-time survey add-on. Targeting Options Use the targeting options available in the Target Audience collector to send your survey to a specific audience. Our panelists have been sorted based on hundreds of targeting options so you can target your audience based on country, demographics, employment status, hobbies, religion, and more. Check out our SurveyMonkey Audience preview page to view our available targeting options. Screening Questions & Disqualification Logic If you want to ask specific questions to find the right people to take your survey, in addition to our targeting options, you can add screening questions with disqualification logic to your survey. For example, you want to find people who have shopped at a particular store in the last 30 days, or who have purchased premium whiskey in the last six months. Screening Questions Screening questions are closed-ended questions that you add to your survey design to either qualify or disqualify people from your target audience, depending on how they answer. TIP! For examples and tips, check out our guide for using screening questions . Disqualification Logic You need to add disqualification logic to any screening questions in your survey. You’ll use question skip logic that’s set to skip to a disqualification page. Adding disqualification logic to your screening questions lets relevant survey-takers complete your survey, while people who don’t qualify for your target audience will skip to a disqualification page. Be careful not to skip disqualified people to the End of Survey —these responses aren't disqualified and count towards the total number of complete responses you ordered. Adding a Screening Question To add a screening question with disqualification logic: In the Survey Design section, add your screening question to the beginning of your survey. From the Options tab, select Require an Answer to This Question . From the Logic tab, add Question Skip Logic . Chose to skip people who don’t qualify for your target audience to a Disqualification Page . Qualification Rate If your survey includes a screening question with disqualification logic, you need to select a qualification rate before you can complete your order. The qualification rate is the estimated percentage of people you expect to qualify for your survey based on your screening questions. The qualification rate you choose affects the number of people we send your survey to. For example, if you want 100 complete responses and you estimate a qualification rate of 50%, we may send your survey to up to 200 panelists. It's better to estimate a lower rate to make sure you get the total number of complete responses you requested. You're responsible for understanding how the qualification rate will affect your order—we're not able to help you choose the appropriate qualification rate for your survey, but you can check out our tips below. To buy responses, your qualification rate needs to be 10% or higher. How Qualification Rate Affects Your Project To make sure you get the number of complete responses you ordered, we adjust the number of people we send your survey to based on your qualification rate. A high qualification rate indicates the type of survey-takers you're looking for are easy to find, and you estimate a high percentage of panelists can qualify for your survey. A low qualification rate indicates the type of survey-takers you're looking for are hard to find, and you estimate a low percentage of panelists can qualify for your survey. Lower qualification rates cost more per response since we have to send your survey to more people. TIP! Use our SurveyMonkey Audience preview page to choose targeting options and qualification rates to better understand how your total cost is affected.

Lower qualification rates cost more per response since we have to send your survey to more people. TIP! Use our SurveyMonkey Audience preview page to choose targeting options and qualification rates to better understand how your total cost is affected. Estimated vs. Actual Qualification Rate When you choose a qualification rate for your project, it's an estimation. Your actual qualification rate is calculated based on the number of people who qualified for your survey out of the total number of people who answered the screening questions. If you already sent your survey, you can see your actual qualification rate in the Target Audience collector. If the actual qualification rate is higher than your estimate , your project should complete on time with the number of complete responses you ordered. If the actual qualification rate is lower than your estimate , you may not get all the complete responses you ordered since more people will be disqualified from your survey. To collect more responses, buy a new order using the actual qualification rate recorded for the survey. To improve the chances of getting the number of complete responses you need, it's better to estimate a lower qualification rate than you expect. However, we aren't able to offer a refund if you misestimated your qualification rate. When you choose a qualification rate for your project, it's an estimation.

Tips for Estimating Qualification Rate Finding just the right people to survey can be a challenge for market research. If you don't know where to begin, don't worry—here are some techniques to help estimate qualification rate: Check your company's market research data . Many companies already know roughly what to expect. Try asking colleagues if they know who would have access to data like this. Do some quick research online . If you're targeting a well-researched population, there may be industry evidence documented online. Run a small test project . You can get a better idea (within a margin of error of +/- 10%) of the qualification rate by surveying just 100 people. This strategy works best if you plan on buying a larger sample and don't mind spending a smaller amount to get a better idea of what your qualification rate might be.

Advanced Analysis Features We have specialized analysis features to help you understand your customer's habits better. If you want to use these features, there are certain things to keep in mind when designing your survey. Key Driver Analysis Key Drivers allow you to choose an outcome metric and then see which attitudes and behaviors of your customers have the highest correlation with that outcome. For example, you could choose the outcome metric of purchase intent then see data points about what drives people to purchase. Setting Up Your Survey to Use Key Drivers The only question type compatible with Key Drivers is the Multiple Choice question . How you set it up depends on what you want to analyze: Outcome metrics use a multiple choice question with 2-7 answer choices. Data points are created from multiple choice questions with the same number of answer choices as the outcome metric. Example If you want to know how often people will use your product, set up a multiple choice question with 5 answer options asking people about frequency of use. Frequency of use would be your outcome metric. Then, any other multiple choice questions in your survey with 5 answer options will show as data points when determining how often people want to use your product. For example, one of these questions could ask people on a 5 point scale how innovative they find your products. This shows as a data point for the frequency of use outcome metric in Key Drivers. Data points create a chart that helps you correlate how these affect each other. Using the example above, you would be able to see how frequency of use changes depending on how innovative people find your product. If you want to know how often people will use your product, set up a multiple choice question with 5 answer options asking people about frequency of use. Frequency of use would be your outcome metric. Then, any other multiple choice questions in your survey with 5 answer options will show as data points when determining how often people want to use your product. For example, one of these questions could ask people on a 5 point scale how innovative they find your products. This shows as a data point for the frequency of use outcome metric in Key Drivers. Data points create a chart that helps you correlate how these affect each other. Using the example above, you would be able to see how frequency of use changes depending on how innovative people find your product.

How is Information Stored? What Can I Alter Safely? Conditional Changes Adding a New Question to a Live Form Whether you have decided to make some small changes, or are overhauling a form between application periods, the possibility of losing currently submitted information as a result of form changes can sometimes lead to cluttered workflows and reports. This guide aims to help administrators know what they can and cannot safely edit within a live form during and after data collection. What is a Live Form? A live form is a form that has collected data at any point in the lifecycle of your site regardless if those responses belong to applicants that are currently accessing your site, applicants that completed the form in a previous cycle, or test applications you created as an administrator to test the form. How is Information Stored? The reason we caution against making major changes to a form as detailed below is that each response that a user gives is stored within the form and within each individual question and choice. For example, within a form you have a question ""What is your favourite colour?"" and you have a dropdown with a list of colour choices. If the applicant selects ""Blue"" as their response, that response is stored within the specific choice of the dropdown. For example: Choice 1: Red Choice 2: Blue Choice 3: Green Choice 4: Yellow Choice 5: Purple So when you are pulling reports or piping information to an email or form, that response is retrievable through the choice selected. If you were to then remove Blue as an option from the list, that applicant's response would also be deleted and would not be available as the labels would shift to meet the new choices available: Choice 1: Red Choice 2: Green Blue Choice 3: Yellow Green Choice 4: Purple Yellow Choice 5: Purple (blank) If you were to pull a report you may notice that depending on where the choice was in the list, the response will either be blank or perhaps the data would be skewed and you may actually see a different colour as the selection of the user. For example, as Green has now become the label for Choice 2, and our applicant has selected Choice 2 as their response, the response in the site would now be Green which is inaccurate information. The same would occur if you were to delete the entire question from the form. As there is no longer a question in the site to store the data that information would no longer be accessible within the site. What Can I Alter Safely? Firstly, editing the contents of a form will not prevent your applicants from accessing or completing the form. In cases where applicants have already completed the form you are making changes to, the complete status will be retained through changes. When you are making alterations to the contents of a form, here are some examples of harmless actions: Adding a completely new question to any page Applying Options or Display settings to an existing question (i.e. sort alphabetically) Moving whole questions within the same page (contents of a question should not be reorganized) Re-ordering pages Editing styling to the form or question (e.g. font size, width, etc.) Editing text descriptions (e.g. Updating dates/years within your question titles and descriptions, correcting typos) What Changes Will Negatively Impact my Form? Here is a list of absolutely ""do not do's"" for form editing. The changes below have the ability to remove your data, and while in some cases changes can be reverted, this is not always the case and can cause even more issues to arise. Conditional Changes Some changes to forms can be considered safe, or cause issues, depending on how you apply them. The most common examples follow. Adding a new choice or variable to an existing question SAFE USE: When you add a new choice or variable to an existing question at the very end of a list, it will be integrated into the question without issue. DO NOT DO: Add a choice or variable to the middle of the list. There is a unique way our system interprets choices entered in closed-ended questions that can cause the data to be skewed if the choice is added to the middle of the choice list. As described above in How is Information is Stored , the selections that the users make are based on the Choice number (i.e. Choice 2) and not the label (""Blue""). Therefore, if you add a new choice above ""Choice 2: Blue,"" Blue will now become the 3rd choice on the list. Creating and removing Branching Logic from forms SAFE USE: Making updates to Branching Logic is a generally safe practice. You can add/edit/remove your branching as you desire without affecting Data. However, it is important to be mindful of 'loops' in your branching. If something is set up in such a way that applicants cannot navigate forward (i.e. marking a required question as invalid entry regardless if it does or does not have a response) it will completely prevent your applicants from moving forward and can be a very frustrating experience. We do not check for these kinds of loops, so you will still be able to save the form if they are present. DO NOT DO: It is very important to keep in mind that branching can only exist because of the questions and content of your form. If you need to delete questions or choices, always make sure to remove branching logic prior to the form change, as it can have some undesired effects on accessibility. Additionally, keep in mind that a 'branching loop' can also cause issues. This is when one branching rule is attempting to perform conflicting actions. For example, trying to both hide and show a task as a result of the same condition, the form will not know what action to take. Adding a New Question to a Live Form New questions can be safely added to a form without affecting previously collected data. For more information on how to add a question please refer to How to Add a Question . NOTE: When you perform this action on a form that already has collected live responses, any user that has completed this task previously will not be asked to come back to the form and update their response. It will remain under the 'Complete' status, and the user will not automatically be informed a change in the form has taken place. Should an applicant need to go back and fill that out, we would recommend contacting the applicant and informing them of the change.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/form-builder-overview/,Form Builder: Overview,"Form Builder: Overview How to Access the Form Builder How to Add a New Question Form Title and Description How to Save your Form How to Preview your Form How to Add a Page Label How to use the Bulk Editor How to use the Visual Editor Form Builder: Overview Form Builder: Overview How to Access the Form Builder How to Add a New Question Form Title and Description How to Save your Form How to Preview your Form How to Add a Page Label How to use the Bulk Editor How to use the Visual Editor The Form Builder will be an essential part of your program workflow if you are going to be designing custom forms with questions in your site. This article will walk through the various sections of the Form Builder and different actions you can take within the Form Builder. How to Access the Form Builder To access the Form Builder: Go to the Workflow Click on the dropdown arrow to the right of the stage Click on the Attached form to the task you are trying to edit How to Add a New Question Adding questions to your form is how you will build your form(s). You can add questions in two ways. To add a question to the middle of the page : Click on the Questions tab on the left side of the Form Builder Click and Drag the question type you wish to add and place it wherever you need to within the page you are on. To add a question to the end of the page : Click on the Questions tab on the left side of the Form Builder Double Click on the question type to have it added to the very end of the page you are on. Form Title and Description The Form Title is what your users see when they enter the form. This is different from the Task Name which the users will view when they are in the main application page. Edit the Form Title When a form is first created, the form title inherits the form name. However, if you wish to edit it: Click on the edit icon next to the form title. Enter the new title you wish to give within the Title field. Click anywhere on the page to save the changes. Add/ Edit the Form Description The Form Description can be extremely useful if you wish to provide details and instructions to your applicants in regards to the steps they need to take to complete the form. Commonly administrators will also enter their own contact details in case an applicant has any questions while filling out the form. To add or edit the Form Description: Click Edit Description. Enter the description you wish to add to the form. Optional: Click Open Visual Editor to customize the styling of the form description. Click Done. NOTE: If you have multiple pages in the form, the Title and Description will appear at the top of every page. Form Title Restriction The initial form title when creating the form cannot be longer than 50 characters when creating the task. Change it later to include: More than 50 characters HTML CSS HTML can be entered directly into the Title and Description fields and it will be observed within the live version of the form. How to Save your Form Saving your form is required for your changes to be visible to users when they enter the form. There are three ways in which your form is saved: Draft Saved automatically Clicking the Save Button but remain in the form Click Save & Close to return to your Workflow NOTE: Changes saved as drafts (auto-saved) will not be visible to other users completing the form until Save or Save & Close has been selected. How to Preview your Form Click on Preview will open a new tab where you can test your form. The form will appear almost exactly as it would to your user. Since you are previewing the form as an administrator, you will also see any Hidden Questions or JavaScript Questions; however, these will not be visible to your regular applicants. NOTE: If your form contains Piping Variables used to pipe information from another form, or to pipe information specific to the user, these piping variables will not work correctly within the preview and the field will appear blank. If you wish to test your Piping Variables we would recommend using a test application. For more information in regards to this you can refer to How to Test your SM Apply Site: Testing Forms . How to Add a Page Label By default, pages are labelled by ""Page #"" based on the page placement in the form. Page labels allow you to create named pages of your form that can then branch or jump users to. Page labels do not have a character type restriction, eg., #@!&$%, or character limit. To change the page title: Click on the Page tab within the form’s editor. Under ""Page Label"" input your new page title. The new name will apply to that page. Repeat this step for each page. TIP! Use Page Labels if each page in your form will have a different purpose, for example, Contact Information, Educational Information, Budget, etc. How to use the Bulk Editor In the case that you have a long list of choices or variables, or a list that you'll be re-using often throughout your many forms, it may be useful to use the bulk editor. The bulk editor converts lists into choices/variables/rows while giving you the option of saving them for use on any future question. The Bulk option is available under all ""Choices"" and ""Variables"" on the left-hand floating editor box. Additionally, you can also save custom bulk lists. To create a custom bulk list: Click on the “Bulk” button when adding choices, variables, rows or columns to a question. Once the dialogue appears, write or paste your list into the text field. Make sure that each item in the list is on a separate line. Enter a name for your list and click Apply . Save a Custom Preset How to use the Visual Editor The visual editor allows you to add text, videos, links, and more to your form. The editor is available in the Question Titles, and Form and Question Descriptions, but not for the Form Title, Choices or Variables. To access the visual editor: Click on the question you wish to edit In the Options tab, click on the question title or extra description text box Click on the Open Visual Editor button beneath the text box. Edit your text using the options available in the visual editor. Click OK . Click the Source button within the visual editor to input HTML or CSS. While Javascript can be placed in the source, we recommend that you place it in a JavaScript question type instead so that you can find it easily if you need to revisit the form in the future.

How to Add Translations to a Form How to Add Translations to a Form How to Translate a Form within the Form Builder How to Translate a Form within the Form Builder What if I don't translate my Form? This article will outline how to add translations to your form so that users can choose which language to view and complete the form in. How to Translate a Form within the Form Builder Within the Form Builder, each language will have its own translated version of the form. When creating the form, by default you will be able to create it in English, however, you may wish to toggle between the different languages available in order to write the translated text. To toggle to another language: Click on the Language icon Select the Language you wish to translate the form in Once you have switched to the new language, you will see the questions appear in the current translated version of the form. Therefore if a user was to toggle the form language, the text that appears within the form builder for that language is what would be displayed to them. If you have not yet translated the form , the default question numbers will appear. In order to translate the form: Go through each question and add the translated text to the Question Title, Description, Choice/ Variable Labels, etc. Ensure that each question has been translated to suit your needs. Save your form. WARNING! When translating your form DO NOT change the structure of the form (eg. Add, Remove, or Rearrange Choices or Variables etc.) The structure of the form is the same throughout all languages on the form and any structural changes made to one language will affect all languages of the form and can affect your collected data. For more information, you can refer to How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form . How to Translate a Form through the Translation Upload Translating the form text within a form can be a long and tedious task if you are trying to translate a large form or multiple forms within your site. You can make translations to the site in Bulk through the Translation section of the site. To translate a form through the Translation Upload: Go to Settings Click More Click Translations Download Translation Template. Within the downloaded CSV you will see a row for each of the questions within the site with the current English Text. Within the additional language column, you can add all of your translations within this CSV. Once you have completed your translation, upload the back to the site under the corresponding language. Check your form to ensure that all of the text within the form has been updated correctly For more detailed steps in regards to uploading a translation CSV please refer to Translations - Overview . What if I don't translate my Form? If you have multiple languages within your site your forms will also be available to your applicants in those languages. As mentioned previously, if you have not yet translated the form, the default question numbers will appear. Here is an example of an untranslated form: As the French translation has not been updated yet, it will appear with the question numbers to the applicants which can cause confusion to your users filling out the form.

You can do so manually for a specific applicant, or automatically if an applicant meets set conditions. This article will walk through how to Hide and Show tasks from applicants within the site. How to Hide/Show a Task Manually Due to special circumstances, you may need to hide or show a task within an individual application. For example, for specific reasons, you do not require an applicant to complete one of your tasks and wish for them to proceed with the application without completion of the task. In this case, you would simply Hide the task for that submission, making the task no longer required. How to Hide a Task How to Show a Task How to Hide a Task In order to hide a task within an application: Go to the Admin Application View Go to the Application Tab Click on the More Options icon beside the task you wish to Hide Select Hide task from the applicant You will be asked, ""Are you sure that you want to hide this task from the applicant?"" Click Yes How to Show a Task In order to show a task within an application: Go to the Admin Application View Go to the Application Tab Click on the More Options icon beside the task you wish to Show Select Show task to the applicant You will be asked, ""Are you sure that you want to show this task to the applicant?"" Click Yes How to Hide/Show Using Automations Show a Task Hide a Task Hide and Show Two Tasks If you wish to Hide or Show tasks on a more consistent basis, you can set up automations to perform this action. For example, depending on an applicants response to a question we may or may not require that they request a recommendation through the site. This example will walk through how to correctly Hide and Show the task based on the applicant's response. We use 2 automations complete this process in case the applicant should re-enter the application form and change their response. Additionally, we would also recommend setting up prerequisites on the task and hiding the task until the prerequisites are met: Go to your Task settings of the task being hidden/shown Click to ""Enable prerequisites for this task"" Select the task used for the activation as the prerequisite Enable ""Hide task until prerequisites are met"" This will ensure that the task will be hidden until the applicant has completed the form and selected the correct response to the question. Show a Task WHEN TO APPLY CONDITIONS Conditions to match: ALL DO Hide a Task WHEN TO APPLY CONDITIONS Conditions to match: ALL DO Hide and Show Two Tasks If you have a case where two tasks are mutually exclusive from each other you can set up two automations similar to above, to hide and show the two applicable tasks. NOTE: For this example, we refer to the use of the Verify Charity Status task, where we have one task to verify Canadian charities, and another to verify US charities.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/branching-logic/,How to use Advanced Branching Logic to Dynamically Change your Form,"How to use Advanced Branching Logic to Dynamically Change your Form How to Add Branching Logic Common Use Cases How to use Advanced Branching Logic to Dynamically Change your Form How to use Advanced Branching Logic to Dynamically Change your Form How to Add Branching Logic Common Use Cases Branching Logic can be used within your form to customize the behaviour of a form based on the responses that a user gives to a question within the form. For example, when a user selects Choice A from one question, you can choose to hide the following question, if it no longer applies given the previous response. How to Add Branching Logic Choose to add Branching Logic if you wish to perform an action within your form. This could be based on a given response to a question, whether a selection to a multiple choice, or checkbox, for example, or a specific response to a text response question. To add Branching Logic to a form: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard icon Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Under the Rule Condition , select a filter from the drop-down. The question chosen will trigger the branching rule. Optional: Add additional rules by clicking the Add Rule icon. If you choose to add more than one condition you can select ANY or ALL conditions to be met in order for the logic to occur. Under Rule Actions , click the Select an action drop-down Select an action from the list Enter many actions by clicking on the next line that appears after you’ve entered the first action. Click Save Rule when you’re done. You will return to the main branching logic page where you can set up more rules. You can also drag and drop the existing rules to reorder them in the list to keep them organized. Once you have set and saved all your rules individually, Click Save on the Main Branching logic page Save the form in order for these changes to appear to your users. Available Rule Actions Every branching logic condition has an action that will occur when the Rule Conditions have been met. The available actions are divided into 3 logic types: Branching Dynamic Advanced Branching Dynamic Advanced Common Use Cases There are many possible use cases in which you may choose to use Branching Logic within your form. The below scenarios will walk through how to set up these various use cases. Terminate a Form Show a Question Show a Message or Warning Hide a Question Permanently 1. Terminate the Form For this scenario, we will walk through how to Terminate the form for a user so that based on a certain response they will be redirected to the main Application page and the task will remain Incomplete. For this example, we want to ensure that the applicant has completed a certain action. For example, ""Have you completed your CPR training?"" The applicant can then choose from the available multiple choice responses, Yes or No. In order for the applicant to complete the rest of the form, they must have obtained their CPR training. Therefore, if they answer No to the question they will be unable to proceed and will be redirected out of the form. However, they may have time to complete their training and therefore will still be able to enter the form and change their answer at a later date. To set up a rule that will Terminate the form given a certain response: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard button at the top right of the form Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Set up the Rule Condition i. Click on the Filter dropdown and select the question ""Have you completed your CPR training?"" from the dropdown. ii. Set the Parameter to ""Value Is Exactly"" iii. Set the Item of the filter to ""No"" Set up the Rule Actions i. Click on the Action dropdown and select Terminate the form 2. Show a Question Another common scenario is to show questions based on a certain response to a question. Expanding on the example above, applicants are presented with the Multiple Choice question, ""Do you have any other certifications?"" where the applicant can select either 'Yes' or 'No.' Using Branching Logic, you can state that if the applicant selects 'Yes', then the Question ""Please list other certifications below."" will appear. However, prior to the response being selected the question will not be visible by default. The setup of this is: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard button at the top right of the form Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Set up the Rule Condition i. Click on the Filter dropdown and select the question ""Do you have any other certifications?"" ii. Set the Parameter to ""Value Is Exactly"" iii. Set the Item of the filter to ""Yes"" Set up the Rule Actions i. Click on the Action dropdown and select Show a Question ii. Select the question you wish to show: ""Please list other certifications below."" 3. Show a Message or Warning This scenario also follows the Show a Question action for branching logic. However, in this scenario, we don't want to show another question we just want to show additional information or text. If this is the case you can add a Section Heading to your form directly below the affected question. Using the same example of Terminate the Form we want to ensure that an applicant has completed their CPR training, and if they haven't then they will be redirected out of the form. However, we want to let them know why they will be redirected out of the form. To do so, we can add a Section Heading question to the form that will double as a warning message that says: ""We require that you have completed your CPR training in order to complete this form. If you have not completed your training you will be redirected out of the form and will be unable to proceed until the training has been completed."" As we only want this to show if they have selected No, we can use the Show Question branching logic to show the Section Heading question text when No is selected. To add this rule: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard button at the top right of the form Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Set up the Rule Condition i. Click on the Filter dropdown and select the question ""Have you completed your CPR training?"" from the dropdown. ii. Set the Parameter to ""Value Is Exactly"" iii. Set the Item of the filter to ""No"" Set up the Rule Actions i. Click on the Action dropdown and select Show a Question ii. Select the question the action should occur for: ""We require that you have completed your CPR training..."" 4. Hide a Question Permanently In some cases, you may require a question to be permanently hidden in the form so that it is no longer visible to your users. A common reason is if your application requirements have changed and the question is no longer applicable. This ensures that the question and previously collected responses are not deleted from the form. To set up this scenario: Click the Advanced Branching Wizard button at the top right of the form Click the Add Branching Rule button to add a new rule Set up the Rule Condition i. Click on the Filter dropdown and select the first question in your form. ii. Set the Parameter to ""Value has a response"" iii. Click Add Rule iv. Click on the Filter dropdown and again select the first question in your form. v. This time set the parameter to ""Value has no response"" vi. Set the rules so that ""Match Any of the following rules"" is selected Set up the Rule Actions i. Click on the Action dropdown and select Hide a Question ii.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/budget-form/,How to Build a Budget Form,"How to Build a Budget Form Building the Questions Calculating the Sub Totals Calculating the Grand Total/Difference Asking users to update their budget later on How to Build a Budget Form How to Build a Budget Form Building the Questions Calculating the Sub Totals Calculating the Grand Total/Difference Asking users to update their budget later on If you require your applicants to complete a budget within your site this can be achieved internally within your form. Alternatively, if you wish for a budget to be uploaded to the application, you can consider uploading a template to the Files section and have them upload it to an Attach File task . NOTE: The calculations provided in this article are examples that can be referenced for formatting purposes. Your calculations will vary based on your own configurations. For more information on setting up calculations, you can refer to Advanced Expression Piping: Overview Building the Questions The most common question types for creating budgets are either Single Column or Multi-Column Questions , using the Text Response variable to allow users to enter their totals. When building out a budget there are often two different sections for the user to complete: Revenue/Income and Expenses. In some cases, you may only request the expenses of the applicants. For this example, we will walk through requesting information about someone's Income and Living Expenses. Start by adding Single Column and/or Multi-Column questions to the form. Set up the rows and columns to allow for applicants to enter their amounts and any other information you need to collect Set a Floating Point Validation on the fields/columns. This will ensure that the values are entered in the correct format to be accepted in the calculation. Set an Identifier on the question. This is an important step to be able to calculate the totals. Repeat the above steps for each section that you need to collect. For our example, this may include Income, Rent/Utilities, Loans, Auto, etc. NOTE: For Step 3, commas and spaces will not be accepted in a calculation and will cause an error if the user enters them in their response. Here are two possible examples of a question setup, however, you can customize your question as you need to. These examples will be referenced throughout the article: Setup A: Multi-Column Setup B: Single Column Calculating the Sub Totals Add in either a Text Response, Hidden Field , and/or Section Heading directly below the question. After each Single-/Multi-Column question that we add, we want to see what the sub-total is for each question. For more information on which question type you should choose, you can refer to Knowing which Question Type to Use Next, we will create our calculation using the identifier we have set on the section. Review Setup A: Multi-Column and Setup B: Single Column below for steps to create your calculation. Setup A: Multi Column Though there are multiple columns in the question, for this example, we only want to calculate the second column into our subtotal. In the Initial Value or Description of the question, start your expression by adding 2 curly brackets {{ Add a space after the second bracket Enter SUM() Within the closed brackets add the identifier, which will be case sensitive. For this example, we set the identifier to be ""income"" Add the column indexing. The Amount column is the second column in the question so it will be [:1] For more information, see Index an Entire Column After your expression, add a space Close your rule with 2 closed curly brackets }} Enable Restore Initial Value to ensure your formula always recalculates if a user changes their responses. When we're done, our questions will look like: Setup B: Single Column Within the Initial Value or Description of the question, start your expression by adding 2 curly brackets {{ Add a space after the second bracket Enter SUM() Within the closed brackets add the identifier, which will be case sensitive. For our example, we set the identifier to be ""rent"" After your expression, add a space Close your rule with 2 closed curly brackets }} Enable Restore Initial Value to ensure your formula always recalculates if a user changes their responses. Since we only have the one column we don't need to reference the column as we do for Multi-Column. Therefore, our final setup will appear as: Calculating the Grand Total/Difference First, we can find the total amount of the expenses incurred (Rent + Loans + Auto). Now that we have added all of our questions and calculated all of our Sub Totals, we want to calculate everything together to determine what the grand total or difference is. This calculation will appear as such, depending on the question type: If you are then looking to find the difference between your Income and Expenses, the calculation may be: NOTE: When performing the above calculations, be aware of our In-Form Piping restrictions which prevent you from performing calculations on a piped value on the same page. For more information, you can refer to our help section on Same Page vs. Next Page Piping Asking users to update their budget later on As time passes, budgets can change. If you need to ask your applicants to update their budget after initially submitting their application, this can best be done using Reusable Applicant Tasks . If you set up your Budget as a Reusable Applicant task you can have a different instance of the same form in a later stage or even in a different program. You can also have the responses auto-populated in the second version of the form to allow the applicant to see their original responses and update them as necessary.

This section of the automation is also referred to as the activation or activation statement and is one of three integral pieces of an automation. This article is an overview of the When statement and how to configure the first piece of your automations. Automation Activations (""WHEN TO APPLY"") ""WHEN TO APPLY"" defines the specific action that will ""activate"" the automation. When the activation occurs, the automation will begin validating conditions within the automation. If the conditions have been met the specified actions will be performed in the order they are listed in the ""DO"" statement. An automation cannot be created or saved without an activation. There are two mandatory selections in finalizing the automation's activation: How to Configure the Activation Setting up the Activation To set up the activation (WHEN TO APPLY) for an automation: Select a Source Select an Event If an application task source, set the Target by first selecting the stage the task exists, then the task title Select Set activation The build above depicts an activation statement after Set activation has been selected. Editing an Activation To edit an activation: Select the Edit icon Update any necessary selections Select Update activation Read the confirmation statement that appears on your screen and confirm WARNING! When an activation source has been changed ALL conditions and actions will be cleared from the automation. If making significant changes to an automation we would strongly recommend duplicating the automation first to have a reference to reconfigure the rules and actions the automation once checked and performed. This occurs due to the availability of some actions and rules with specific activation sources. Modifying the Activation Source Certain actions and conditions are not available for particular activations. Because of this, if the source activation is cleared you will be presented with the following warning: This will be displayed anytime an activation source is changed to notify you that all conditions and actions set for the automation will be REMOVED . This action cannot be undone. If making extensive changes to an automation that would result in clearing the progress you've made, we would recommend proceeding as follows: Duplicate your current automation Update the copied version Set the conditions and actions for the copied automation, referring to the original where applicable If the source of the activation is not being changed then this warning can be ignored.

Setting up Scoring in Your Form One of the most common uses for Advanced Review Forms is the scoring feature which allows you to assign a point value to your reviewers' responses. Having scoring within your form allows you to add automations to your system and to filter applications. This is commonly used for when a reviewer completes their review of an application, you can set an automation to move their application to the next stage based on the score. Example: If applications are scored out of 20, you can set up automations so that: any application that receives a total score of less than 10 be moved to an Ineligible Holding Stage . any application that receives a score of 10-20 be moved to a second review stage. Scoring makes it easier when it comes to making the decision of who to Award and Decline for your program. You can add scores to the following question types, the commonality being that they are all close-ended (minus Checkbox) questions: Multiple Choice Dropdown Single Column - Dropdown Single Column - Radio Buttons Multi-Column - Dropdown Multi-Column - Radio Buttons Drill Down Ranking Question When one of the above questions has been added to the form, default scoring will automatically be applied. Default Scoring is applied in order to assist you further when setting up your advanced review form. The scoring of the choice will be displayed next to the choice within the question. The steps to adding/editing the scoring will vary based on the type of question, however, it will be added to each of the ""Choices"" section in the questions above. NOTE: The image above displays the Choices section of a multiple choice question.

These actions can include sending an email, moving an application to another stage, adding a label to an application, among others. The DO statement is the final piece required to complete the setup of an automation. Automation Actions (""DO"") Overview Actions cannot be selected unless the activation of the automation has been set as the actions available are dependent on the activation selected. An automation can perform multiple actions, but a minimum of one action must be provided in order to save your progress. NOTE: Automations will not fire unless they're activated . WARNING! If an action is not available, it is usually due to the activation selection made earlier in the automation setup. Changing the source of the WHEN statement will result in clearing ALL rules in the Condition AND all actions listed in the DO statement. If the activation is changed and the automation is saved, these rules and actions cannot be restored. The Action Menu A dropdown menu is used to select the actions that the automation will perform. The menu is entered when the -- Select an action -- dropdown arrow or title is selected. This menu is similar to the menu used to set the activation of your automation and consists of a Source menu on the left and an Event menu on the right . How to Add Actions An automation must have a minimum of one action to perform when the activation and conditions are met. When building the automation an automation will need to be present before being able to save your WHEN statement or Conditions. To add the first action: Select the -- Select an action -- dropdown menu Select the Source from the left menu Select the Event from the right menu Select any attributes required to complete the action such as the stage the application will move to, the label that will be applied, the Save the automation. This process can be followed to add all actions, but may not cover the attributes required for some available actions. See How to Send an Automated Email and How to Automatically Apply a Custom Field Value for the steps required to add these advanced actions. To add additional actions: Select Add (plus sign) to display another action to configure Select -- Select an action -- and configure the new action Repeat as required Ordering Actions in a Single Automation The order of actions should be listed in the order the actions should occur. When an automation is activated and the conditions are validated, actions will commence starting with the action in position 1. To provide an example of how this order can affect your process, let's walk through a sample automation that updates an application label to mark that the applicant has submitted more than one application. For our example, the actions are performed by a single automation in the following order: Add label to application Value: Secondary Application Remove all labels from application In this order, the label is applied but then immediately removed. This means that the application is updated, but the label does not remain on the application.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/question-types/,Form Question Types: Overview,"Form Question Types: Overview Choosing the Right Question Types Question Types Form Question Types: Overview Form Question Types: Overview Choosing the Right Question Types Question Types SurveyMonkey Apply has 16 different question types to help you collect the data you need within a form task. These questions have different input fields or type of responses the user can enter resulting in more than 16 question configurations. It’s important to choose the right question and configuration so you can collect usable data. Choosing the Right Question Types Form responses help automate your workflow, assign applications to reviewers, and more. For example, if the user’s GPA is greater than 4.0, you can automate, or move, the applicant to the next round. Keep that in mind when choosing a question type. Think about the data analysis you want to perform before you build your form. For example, if you collect text responses, you’ll gain more insight, but limit your ability to analyze data in a graph or chart. Open-Ended Questions Open-Ended Questions, such as a text response, allow you to gain a bit more insight into your users. You can make a text response question Multiline in order to ask your users to give longer responses or write an essay within the form and even set word limits on the responses they give. Closed-Ended Questions Closed-ended questions, such as multiple choice, or dropdown, etc., allow you to ask your users questions and force them to give a specific answer. This can allow you to then report on how many users chose choice 1 vs choice 2. It also allows you to place a Score or value on the response the user gave or even create an automation based on their response. Section Headings Section Headings are great for adding additional text and headings within the form, however, there are a few limitations to them compared to the rest of the question types. Using Section Headings, you cannot: Create an Advanced Branching Rule based off of them Filter users or applications based on a section heading Add a section heading to a report Question Types Question types fall under basic and advanced question type categories. Basic questions are the most common and have a straightforward setup. Advanced questions require a bit more time and configuration to setup. Each question will have its own setup and configurations available. You can refer to the articles linked below based on the Question type you wish to set up.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/automation-conditions/,Automations: “CONDITIONS”,"Automations: “CONDITIONS” What are Conditions? Explaining Matching Criteria Adding New Rules Editing or Deleting Rules Nesting Rules Automations: “CONDITIONS” Automations: “CONDITIONS” What are Conditions? Explaining Matching Criteria Adding New Rules Editing or Deleting Rules Nesting Rules The second component of any automation within SM Apply is the Condition which is the set of rules that determine whether the automation will fire when the activation has occurred. This article covers the basics of these rules including how to configure rules to complete your automation. What are Conditions? Conditions Conditions are the set of rules that will be validated after the activation of an automation has occurred. These rules are not required for the setup of an automation and many basic automations may bypass this entirely. An automation will not fire unless all rules listed as Conditions have been satisfied. Below is an explanation of the various parts that make up the conditions of an automation. ""Select a Filter"" Menu A dropdown menu is used to select the rules that the automation will validate before performing the actions stated within the DO statement. The menu is entered when the -- Select a filter -- dropdown arrow or title is selected. This menu is similar to the menu used to set the activation of your automation in that it consists of a Source menu on the left and an Event menu on the right. Explaining Matching Criteria The Matching Criteria setting is the first component of the Condition and determines when the rules are considered to be satisfied. There are two options as described earlier: ALL or ANY. If an automation did not activate for an expected application, check the matching criteria to ensure that the correct option has been chosen. To set or edit the matching criteria of your automation simply toggle to selection as shown below. If you are editing the matching criteria of an active automation be sure to save your changes. Setting the matching criteria is all or nothing. In some cases, you may have a combination of rules where there are certain rules that must be met and a variety of others where one rule must be met. For more information on this use case, see Nesting . Adding New Rules How to Add a Rule By default, a single rule will appear available to configure when an automation is created. To configure your first rule: Set the Matching Criteria of your Condition Select the Select a filter dropdown menu Select the Task or Action group from the left-hand side of the menu Select the action, completion status, or other condition from the right-hand side of the menu. This will close the first dropdown menu. Select the Matching Parameter for the rule. This is the second dropdown menu available within the rule. Select the third dropdown and complete your rule by selecting a specific Item How to Add Additional Rules In some cases, it may be necessary to compile multiple rules for a single automation for the appropriate actions to take place. To add additional rules: Select Add Rule (plus sign) Set the filter, matching parameter, and item to complete the rule Editing or Deleting Rules How to Edit a Rule Once a rule has been added it can be edited as needed. This may be due to a change in your process, or to modify an automation that has been configured incorrectly. To edit a rule: Enter the automation where the rule exists to edit the condition Select the filter, matching parameter, or item dropdown to edit Save the automation for the changes to take affect How to Delete a Rule To delete a rule: Select Delete to remove the associated rule Save the automation for changes to take effect Deleting a rule cannot be reverted. Deleted rules can only be recovered by recreating the rule altogether. Nesting Rules Overview Once the matching criteria has been set for your Condition, all rules that have been listed are checked to ensure that either ALL of the rules are satisfied or ANY (at least one). In some cases, this may not satisfy the eligibility required for your automation. To bypass this you are given the ability to Nest rules together which ultimately groups a minimum of two rules together and allows the builder to assign the group its own matching criteria. There are two requirements in order to be able to nest: There must be at least one existing rule There must be a minimum of two rules to nest TIP! Nesting may not be necessary if the responses conditional responses needed for a specific action are choices for a single question. Make use of the matching parameters 'is one of' or 'is not one of' to state that multiple answers are acceptable under a single rule. How to Create a Nested Rule Group To nest two or more rules together: Configure at least one rule within the condition Select Add Rule to add the next rule Select Nest Rule Set the matching criteria Configure a minimum of two rules to be nested Optional: To add more than two rules within a single nested group, select the Add Rule icon associated with one of the nested rules to add another rule to the existing nested group Optional: T o add another rule that is not nested, select the Add Rule icon for any rules that do not exist within the nested group. This action will add a new rule underneath the nested group. A single condition can contain multiple nested rules. Similarly, a new nested group can be created within an existing nested group. Example of a Nested Rule To demonstrate with an example, assume an application form is a required task for one of your programs. Based on a set of responses, an automation will determine which labels will be applied to the application. Three questions are asked: What are your plans after University/College? Where were you born? Where do you currently live? If the applicant answers Travel to question 1 the label Travel will be applied to the application through this automation. However, based on the eligibility of the program, only applicants that were born in Canada or currently live in Canada should be labelled with the Travel label. Based on these conditions, the single matching criteria of ALL or ANY will not satisfy all three rules that are required. If the matching criteria was set to ALL , the applicant would need to provide ALL of the following answers: BUT, the criteria for this label only requires Canada as an answer to Question 2 OR 3. If the criteria is switched to ANY , the applicant would need to provide ANY of the following answers: This would mean that if the applicant provides any ONE of those answers, they will be given the Travel label which is incorrect since they must answer Travel to Question 1 and Canada to either Question 2 or 3.

They are most commonly added to questions when you require the use of Advanced Expression Piping (AEP) within your form. They are short, one word, values made up of letters and numbers. How to add an Identifier In order to add an Identifier to a question: Access the Form Builder of the form you are looking to edit. Click on the Question you wish to add the identifier to. On the left of the screen under the question type dropdown is the Identifier . If you have no value currently as an identifier the value will say None.

Once the Identifier has been added you will notice it will appear as small, text above the question. Question identifiers are case sensitive, must begin with a letter, and may only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. TIP! To ensure that you can easily identify the question later, make sure the identifier is related to the question. For example, if you have a question that asks for the ""Home Address"" of your applicant, an identifier you may use would be home_address or home address . For longer questions, it is still important to keep the identifier short, therefore for questions such as ""Name your top 3 favorite colors"" your identifier may be favorite colors or three colors. How does the Identifier Appear within the Site When the identifier is added to the question this is how it will be identified internally throughout the site, it will replace the original question which is why it is important that it is related to the question so you can easily identify it later.

The following article will outline why duplicating a program can be a useful process, how to duplicate a program in your site, and what exactly will be duplicated. Why is it useful? Duplicating a program can be a useful step if you wish to have multiple programs in your site with very similar workflows and setups. Instead of creating each program from scratch you can simply create one and duplicate it. Another reason you may have to duplicate your workflow is if you are beginning a new cycle of your program and wish to make changes to the workflow. You will be able to duplicate the old program, take it offline, and make changes for the new year or cycle. How to Duplicate a Program To duplicate a Program: Go to your Site Dashboard Beside your program click on the More Options icon. Click Duplicate Your Program will be duplicated as ""Copy of [Original Name] (1)"". Without renaming the Copy, a subsequent duplicate of either the original or the first copy will be named ""Copy of [Original Name] (2)"".

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/send-automated-email/,How to Send an Automated Email,"How to Send an Automated Email How to Set Up an Automated Email Setting Up Email Recipients Composing the Email Common Use Cases Email Notifications How to Send an Automated Email How to Send an Automated Email How to Set Up an Automated Email Setting Up Email Recipients Composing the Email Common Use Cases Email Notifications The purpose of this article is to provide an in-depth look at how to send emails from your site using automations. How to Set Up an Automated Email In order to set up an automated email: Create a new program or stage automation on your site. Set up the Activation (""When to Apply"") Optional: Add Conditions Under the DO section , click the --Select an Action-- dropdown As the Action Source , click User As the Action , select Send an Email to Choose who the email will Send From. These emails will be populated based on the emails available within the Email section of your site. Enter who the email will Send To. For more information, please refer to Setting up Email Recipients below. Enter the email subject Optional: Add attachments to include in the email Compose your Email Click Save Setting Up Email Recipients Within the recipients box there are two options to choose from: 1. Send the email to a specific email address or addresses The first option is to simply enter the email address in the text box (ie. you@example.com). This means that every time the automation fires the email will always be sent to the same email address(es). This is commonly used when you would like an automated email to be sent to an administrator of the site when certain activity occurs. 2. Send the email to a variable email address In most cases, you will need to send the email to different recipients based on the need for the automation. For example, if you need the email to send to the user that activated the automation you would need to enter the variable {{ user.email }} as opposed to the individual's email. If you simply want to send the email to the owner of the application you can enter {{ applicant.email }}. TIP! Copy and paste the variables above into the recipient box, or make use of the Piping Tool and use keywords to search for the right variable. Composing the Email Subject This is the field where you can enter the subject line of the email. Email body Here you can customize the email as you see fit. By using the Piping icon you can also input piping variables to further customize the email with user or applicant sourced data. For more information, see Piping Variables: Overview . You can also send a test email by clicking the button Send Test Email and selecting an address to send it to. As a note, if you have piping variables in the email, the information will not be piped in when the email is sent, this is simply a feature to test proper delivery and formatting of the email. For more information in regards to testing email automations, refer to How to Test your Site . Attachments Here is where you can add files to your emails that you would like sent out to users. Common Use Cases Listed below are common cases we see for setting up an automated email in the site. There are many different possibilities, however, here are a few to get you started. Send Email to Admin When a Review is Completed In this scenario we will set up an automation that is meant to send an email to you as an administrator when a reviewer in your site has completed one of their reviews to the Advanced Review Form called ""Overall Ranking"". This can be useful for tracking purposes for keeping track of your reviewers' progress in the site. WHEN TO APPLY CONDITIONS Not Required for this scenario DO The above email would be setup to send an email to you. The subject line would pull in the Reviewer's Name to state Theresa Jones has completed a review. Within the Email Message there are also several variables that will pull in to give you more information on the instance that caused the email to send: Dear Sarah, Theresa Jones has completed a review within the site for the application ""Tom Jenkin's Application to a Program"" on Friday, June 02, 2017 at 12:05 PM (UTC). Application has been Awarded The following scenario would be used to send an email to applicants when they have been selected as Awarded for a program. Setting up an automated email, as opposed to manual, can be useful if you are ""awarding"" a large number of candidates, or you are going to be awarding candidates consistently and wish to send out one congratulatory email to all those that were successful. WHEN TO APPLY CONDITIONS Not Required for this scenario DO As all Automations are Program Specific you will need to create a new automation for each program you have within your site. The same process can be taken for declined applications as well by changing the Event of the Activation to Application has been Declined, and rewording the email. Move to Next Stage The following scenario will walk through how to setup an automated email to notify the applicant that their application has been promoted onto a new stage. In this example, the email is sent to the applicant when the application has been moved to the 2nd Application Stage. WHEN TO APPLY CONDITIONS Not Required for this scenario DO Post-Review Email with Reviewer Comments The following scenario will walk through how to setup an automation to email applicants when their application has been reviewed. This email will also pull specific reviewer comments that were given about the application and other user sourced data. This email set up will be based on when a specific reviewer completes a review for the application and will email the applicant when each reviewer completes their review. WHEN TO APPLY CONDITIONS Not Required for this scenario DO Email Notifications Before creating a custom automated email for a program, check the Site Notifications of the site to confirm whether or not SurveyMonkey Apply has already created a template for you. The Notifications section is meant for emails that should be consistently sent out for all programs in the site. Some of these notifications include confirming that the applicant has submitted their application, letting the reviewer know they have applications to review, and even informing an Administrator that a reviewer has left a note on an application.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/stages-overview/,Stages: Overview,"Stages: Overview Types of Stages The Order of Stages Stages: Overview Stages: Overview Types of Stages The Order of Stages Stages are an essential part of the SurveyMonkey Apply system. They determine the flow of your application process. For example, one stage may be your application stage, and the next is your review stage. This article will help you to better understand what a stage is and why it is important in your site. Types of Stages Within SM Apply there are four types of stages: Applicant, Simple Review, Advanced Review, and Holding Stages. The type of stage will define the tasks that can exist within the stage. When a program is first created an Application Stage will populate automatically. The Order of Stages The order of stages in your Workflow is very important as it determines the flow of your application process. When an application is first created it will be automatically placed into the first stage in your workflow unless otherwise configured using automations. You can choose to rearrange the stages in your workflow to ensure that all stages are in the correct order by hovering your cursor over the stage and using the Move icon to drag the stage to a new position. NOTE: You will not be able to move the first stage in the workflow as it is required to have an Application Stage as the first stage.

Therefore, when pulling reports and viewing the forms, the responses you have collected are associated to the question. Altering the form, such as removing questions, or adding or removing options from a dropdown or checkbox type question can skew the data. For example if you remove a question from a form, the answers that have been given to that question will be removed from the system.

Common formats are: ""The Action: Brief Summary of the Automation"" OR ""Activation -> Action"" For example, if an automation is used to move an application to another review stage based on a response in a ranking form, the automation could be named: ""Move: Approved Application to Follow-Up Review"" OR ""Upon Approval - > Move to Follow-Up Review Stage"" This title allows any administrator within the site to search and modify the automation easily should any changes be made to the program's process in later cycles. The main purpose of this formatting is to allow you to organize and manage your automations. TIP! If your automation performs multiple actions, be sure to include both actions in your title to help you find it later. An example of this would be ""Move & Email: Application Form Completed."" Organize automations into Folders When many automations have been added to a single program, it is easy to become overwhelmed when trying to locate a specific automation. It is recommended to make use of Automation Folders to help with their organization. Adding folders with titles such as ""Move,"" ""Emails,"" and ""Date Activation"" are some examples based on actions your automations will perform, but you may find that it is more practical to name folders following the custom application labels or statuses you have created for your programs. To create a new folder from the Automations page: Select the Folders icon Select Create New Add a name for the Folder Select OK To add an automation to a folder from the Automations page: Mark the automation Select Folders Select the folder that best describes your automation NOTE: Automations can only be associated with one folder at a time.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/collaborators/,Collaborators: Overview,"Collaborators: Overview How to Enable Collaborators on a Program How to Configure Collaborator Access What Happens Next? Collaborators: Overview Collaborators: Overview How to Enable Collaborators on a Program How to Configure Collaborator Access What Happens Next? Enabling Collaborators on a program allows a user to add additional members to their application. This is useful for applications requiring collaboration and multi-user access without those users needing to share a login account for access. How to Enable Collaborators on a Program Enabling Collaborators is specific to each program in your site. In order to enable collaborators: Go to the Program Settings Go to the Applications tab Enable Allow Collaborators Optional: Restrict collaborators to specific email domains. An example of this would be if your organization is an education system and wish to ensure that only users with your institutions' domain are added to the application. Optional: Add instructions to your applicants on who they should invite to their application Save & Exit the Program How to Configure Collaborator Access If you wish to configure which tasks in your workflow your collaborators will have access to you can enable a setting in each task. NOTE: This process will only determine who can Edit the task, however, all members of the application will be able to View all completed forms in the application. Go to the Workflow Access the Stage Configurations of the Application Stage Go to the Tasks tab Click on the Task Click on the dropdown under ""Set who can edit this task"" NOTE: This is only available if Collaborators are enabled Select the restriction between the three Options Available i. Applicants & Collaborators ii. Applicants Only iii. Collaborators Only NOTE: By Default ""Applicants & Collaborators"" will be selected for each applicant task. Optional: If ""Collaborators Only"" was selected, enter instructions on who the applicant should request as a collaborator to complete the task. Example: Applicants in your site under the age of 18 require a consent form from their Parent or Guardian. Therefore, we want to add the Parent/ Guardian as a collaborator of the site in order to access the application and complete the consent form. However, we do not wish for the Applicant to be able to edit this form themselves. Therefore, based on the steps above we would select ""Collaborators Only."" What Happens Next? Once you have configured the collaborator process within your program and workflow, Applicants will be able to begin inviting collaborators to their application. There are three major components to this process: 1. Applicant Completes the Collaborator Invite Within the applicant's application on the left side of the screen, they will be able to click the Add Collaborators button. Upon doing so they can enter the email address of the collaborator they are adding, set the permissions of the user to View & Edit or View Only and provide an optional message to the collaborator. NOTE: If you have a Collaborator Only task, collaborators would need to have View & Edit status in order to edit the task. 2. Collaborator Receives the Invite Once the invite is sent the collaborator will receive it at the email provided by the applicant. Within the email, the collaborator will be able to Join the application or Decline the invite. Upon clicking Join Now within the email the collaborator will be able to either Login or complete the registration process, depending on if they already have an account. Once they have logged in they will be successfully added as a collaborator to the application. NOTE: If the collaborator is sent an invite to multiple applications, they will need to Join each application through the email that is sent. 3. Collaborator completes any required tasks After the Collaborator has accepted the request and logged in they will have access to the application. Their permissions will depend both on the settings that have been given to the task as well as the permissions set by the applicant.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/forms-overview/,Forms: Overview,"Forms: Overview What is the Form Builder? Examples of Forms How is Data Saved With a Form? Forms: Overview Forms: Overview What is the Form Builder? Examples of Forms How is Data Saved With a Form? Forms allow you to collect user data that will help you make decisions in your application process. Apply uses a simple form builder offering multiple question types such as multiple choice, text response, or dropdowns, as well as form logic to tailor the form to your applicant and summarize rankings. What is the Form Builder? The Form Builder is used to create and customize the forms within your site. For more information about navigating around the Form Builder, you can refer to the article: Form Builder - Overview . Within a form you can: Add a New Question Add Piping Variables Add Advanced Expression Piping Add Advanced Branching Logic Create Translations of your forms Examples of Forms Forms within your programs are completely customizable based on your needs. We've provided some examples of applicant , recommender and reviewer forms below to get you started. These examples can also be combined into a single form, if that fits your process. Examples of Applicant Forms Examples of Recommender Forms TIP! Use a recommendation form as opposed to having your recommenders upload a letter to ensure that you are getting all the pertinent information you need to make an accurate decision. This will also allow you to report on the responses given by the recommenders. Examples of Reviewer Forms How is Data Saved With a Form? Within SurveyMonkey Apply, we use unique identifiers to store and match up data. Every task, form, question, and choice has a unique ID that allows us to match up that question and choice to the User and the Application that gave the response. Therefore, when an applicant completes the application form within your site, their responses are stored within that form. To break that down even further, each individual response they give is stored within the questions and choices within that form. For example: The Applicant Tom Jenkins opens the ""Application Form"" and is asked the question ""What is your favorite color?"" This question gives him the options of: Choice 1: Red Choice 2: Blue Choice 3: Green Choice 4: Yellow Choice 5: Purple He selects Blue as his favorite color. Tom's response is recorded as Choice 2 , which has the label Blue. When pulling reports or piping this information into other areas of the site, we would be able to pipe in this response of Choice 2 as it has been stored within the question. Why is this Important? This information is important to know to ensure that changes in your form do not impact your data. If you are deleting questions/choices or restructuring a form then this could delete or skew your responses. For example, if the second choice in the list gets changed to Pink. Then because Choice 2 now equals Pink, Tom's response will be displayed as Pink as well. Therefore the change would result in inaccurate information. For more information in regards to this, we highly recommend referring to the article How to Safely Make Changes to a Live Form to ensure that you are not making changes that will negatively affect your data.

For example, you may require applicants to submit all application materials by a deadline, or your reviewers to complete all of their reviews. Our Deadlines feature will allow you to apply these limits to your Stages on your site. If you wish to apply a deadline to a specific applicant task you can refer to How to Set a Deadline on an Applicant Task . How to Apply a Stage Deadline Stage deadlines prevent applicants, recommenders or reviewers from accessing a stage and all the tasks in that stage after the deadline has passed. You can apply a deadline to a stage with the following steps: Go to your Workflow Click on the Name of the stage to access the stage configurations. Click on Settings Click on the Close Date/ Deadline field to access the Date Calendar Select a deadline date you wish to apply to the stage. Add a Time for when the deadline will be closed. The time zone that is set will be based on your sites time zone. However, to the end user, the time will be converted to display in the user's time zone. Optional: Enter a grace period (in hours) . Grace periods allow users to access or edit a stage after the deadline has passed. This grace period will not be displayed to the users. This value can only be a whole number and the grace period cannot be placed with a decimal, such as 1.5. You can now click Save to confirm your changes. NOTE: The stage deadline will be automatically applied to all tasks within the stage. However, if an individual task has its own task deadline, the task deadline will override the stage deadline, provided that the deadline on the task is before the stage deadline. How Deadlines Work Deadlines require users to complete stages by certain dates so your process can stay on schedule. Once a deadline for a stage passes, users can no longer access or edit the tasks within the stage. Deadlines on Reviewer Tasks Since Reviewer stages can only contain one reviewer task per stage, if you wish to apply a deadline to the reviewer task you can do so by applying the deadline to the Reviewer Stage instead.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/apply/build/attachment-formats/,Accepted File Formats for Attachments,"Accepted File Formats for Attachments Document Formats Attaching Word Documents and Excel Spreadsheets Attaching PDF Files Video Formats Audio Formats Linked Media Formats File Sizes Accepted File Formats for Attachments Accepted File Formats for Attachments Document Formats Attaching Word Documents and Excel Spreadsheets Attaching PDF Files Video Formats Audio Formats Linked Media Formats File Sizes This article will outline the accepted file formats of each task in your site. The accepted formats can be customized by you as an administrator in some tasks to suit the needs of your process. These formats can be altered within the Options (or File Options) tab of the Document/Image, Portfolio, and Attach File tasks listed below. Document Formats Portable Document Format File (.pdf) Microsoft Word Document (.doc) Microsoft Word Open XML Document (.docx) Microsoft Excel Document (.xls) Microsoft Excel Open XML Document (.xlsx) Attaching Word Documents and Excel Spreadsheets When a user attaches a Word Document and an Excel spreadsheet it will remain available within the site in its original format. Therefore, it can be downloaded from the site and viewed within Word or Excel. It will not be converted within the site or viewable internally within the system. If this is a process you require we would recommend restricting the attachments to PDF to ensure the file can be viewed online. Attaching PDF Files When a user attaches a PDF file, it's converted and made viewable within your Apply site. This conversion process only works for PDF files without JavaScript features enabled. Because JavaScript in PDF files can pose serious security risks, when trying to upload a PDF, you'll see an error message if the file contains JavaScript. If your process requires the use of interactive PDFs containing JavaScript to, for example, populate the current date on a field in your PDF, etc., removing the JavaScript may break that functionality. Admins may need to update workflows depending on the purpose of the JavaScript. Options to consider include removing the JavaScript from the PDF, using a PDF editor to create fillable forms that don’t use JavaScript. If applicants are submitting images in PDF format, consider using Image Upload instead. Removing JavaScript from PDFs To remove Javascript from a PDF, you can open the PDF in your viewer of choice and print to PDF. This process will retain pre-filled form information but it won't be editable. For more information on printing to PDF, see the links below for Windows and Mac instructions. Mac: Save a document as a PDF on Mac Windows: View, print, and edit PDFs in a PDF reader - Microsoft Support Video Formats In the case that you wish for your students to attach a video as a file, there are two available formats that are accepted. Audio Video Interleaved (.avi) MPEG-4 (.mp4) NOTE: Using the Linked Media attach type, you can have your applicants copy a link to their YouTube/Vimeo media instead. Audio Formats There are two formats available for audio files: MP3 Audio File (.mp3) WAVE Audio Format (.wav) Within the task settings, you can enable either of these formats or both if necessary. After the audio file is attached, click on the file to open it in a new tab. Linked Media Formats This attachment type allows you to collect videos from your applicants that are stored in an outside source. The two formats available are: YouTube Vimeo Applicants will be able to link their YouTube/Vimeo media to this task in order for the media to be considered with their application. File Sizes When it comes to file sizes we typically suggest a maximum file size of 1000MB. The smaller the file size, the faster it will be to attach the file and view it on the site. Within your attach a file tasks you can set restrictions on the file sizes users can attach. Having restrictions will ensure that the users don't exceed these limits. Files that are too large may experience difficulties while attaching or downloading the file in the site. If you do require users to attach larger file sizes, you will just need to be aware that this can affect the download speed when you are attempting to download applications from the site. You will want to download the applications in smaller increments, to ensure no issues or timeouts arise during the download process.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/teams/single-sign-on/#RespondentAuth,Single Sign-On (SSO),"Single Sign-On (SSO) How SSO Works Setting Up SSO Logging In and Managing Login Credentials Troubleshooting Login Errors Enabling Respondent Authentication Single Sign-On (SSO) Single Sign-On (SSO) How SSO Works Setting Up SSO Logging In and Managing Login Credentials Troubleshooting Login Errors Enabling Respondent Authentication How SSO Works ENTERPRISE FEATURE: Single Sign On (SSO) Single Sign-On (SSO) lets everyone on your Enterprise team log in to SurveyMonkey using your organization’s corporate login credentials. SSO removes the need to maintain a separate SurveyMonkey username and password. Your organization can control who can access your SurveyMonkey team and create authentication policies for increased security. SurveyMonkey’s SSO solution follows the S​AML 2.0 specification and is Service Provider (SP) initiated. SSO glossary Term Description Service Provider (SP) A vendor that provides services to your organization. In relation to SSO, the SP is SurveyMonkey. Identity Provider (IdP) A company that provides user authentication services. IdPs manage whether an employee can access a SP, like SurveyMonkey or other applications. Okta and ADFS are common IdPs. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) The language the IdP and SP communicate in. SurveyMonkey follows the SAML 2.0 technical specifications to exchange info with your organization's IdP. Attributes Pieces of info about an employee that an IdP uses for authentication. SurveyMonkey requires 4 attributes—FirstName, LastName, Email, and NameID. Claim Types Pieces of info about a user on a team that SurveyMonkey accepts. Attributes from your IdP need to be mapped to SurveyMonkey claims so SSO works correctly. Assertion An assertion is made up of one or more statements. SurveyMonkey requires certain attribute statements in our assertions. Setting Up SSO After your organization upgrades to an Enterprise plan, you'll be given the option to set up SSO for your team's account—only 1 IdP per Enterprise team. We'll then contact your team’s Primary Admin to start the setup process and connect with your IT department. We recommend waiting to invite people to your Enterprise team until SurveyMonkey confirms that SSO is set up properly. TIP! If you already have an Enterprise plan, reach out to your CSM to get set up with SSO. Here's a high-level breakdown of what to expect when setting up SSO: Input and map metadata Your unique SurveyMonkey metadata (Entity ID and ACS URL) is provided to you by your Technical Solutions Manager. Mapping guide Example IdP attributes Claim types SurveyMonkey accepts Mapping Unique, non-changing identifier (e.g. UPN or employee ID) NameID Required Email, emailaddress Email Required FirstName, first.name, givenname, Given-Name FirstName Required Surname LastName Required Department, DepartmentID, department name Department Optional* CostCenter, cost center number CostCenterCode Optional* * Optional attributes can help you track and monitor team activity in the User Report . * Optional attributes can help you track and monitor team activity in the User Report . Send us your metadata Send SurveyMonkey your organization's metadata URL. If you’re unable to send the metadata URL, provide the XML file. We'll set up SSO in our system and send you steps to validate that it's working correctly. We need the following from you: Entity ID HTTP Redirect Endpoint X.509 Certificate (specifically the Signing KeyType) SurveyMonkey will set up SSO in our system and send you steps to validate that it's working correctly. Invite employees to access SurveyMonkey If you want to restrict some employees from accessing your team, you can use a security group to permit or deny claims on the IdP side. Primary Admins and Admins can always see how many Empty seats are available on their team from the Team Summary . When you’re ready, click Add Users from the top navigation bar and then Copy link to share with people you want to invite. Users will be able to create or convert an account to log in with SSO. Check if a user has SSO enabled After your organization sets up SSO, Admins can see whether or not a user has SSO enabled on their Survey Monkey account. Go to My Team and select Manage Users . Search for the person by entering their email. The SSO column will show a key icon next to the user’s email if SSO is enabled. If they don’t have SSO enabled, it could be for a few different reasons. Connect with your Customer Success Manager to learn more. Logging In and Managing Login Credentials Create or convert an account The first time you log in to an SSO enabled SurveyMonkey account, choose to Create a new account or Convert an account .

Enabling Respondent Authentication SSO-enabled accounts can use Respondent Authentication to send more secure internal surveys and track the people taking your survey with SSO metadata. Respondents don't need a SurveyMonkey account to take the survey. TIP! Primary Admins can set a default Respondent Authentication setting for their entire Enterprise team. Require survey takers to log in with SSO Respondent Authentication on the Web Link collector only requires survey takers to log in through SSO to access your survey, without needing a SurveyMonkey account. Responses are tracked with their SSO metadata—first name, last name, and email address. It isn't possible to make responses anonymous when Respondent Authentication is turned on. Respondent Authentication is for surveys taken on personal devices—don't enable Respondent Authentication on a public or shared device. To turn on Respondent Authentication: Log in to SurveyMonkey using your organization’s corporate login credentials ( SSO ). Go to the Collect Response section of your survey. Add a Web Link collector. Or, click the name of an existing Web Link. Click Respondent Authentication . Select On, your respondents need to authenticate to take your survey .

Add your custom theme to the library and save commonly used themes as templates to create consistency across all team surveys.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/wufoo/build/importing/,Importing Predefined Choices in Bulk,"Importing Predefined Choices in Bulk Importing Predefined Choices in Bulk Importing Predefined Choices in Bulk There are lots of multiple choice fields that you always see on forms—things like Gender, Age, Employment, Income, Education, Days of the Week, and U.S. States. Likewise, it's really common to ask people to evaluate how often they do something, how satisfied they are with an experience, or how important something is to them. Even though these questions are super common, sometimes it's tricky to figure out the best way to word these field labels and answer choices. And for things like a dropdown of U.S. States, it would be time-consuming to add every choice one by one. Wufoo provides lots of pre-written sets of answer choices (available in English only) that you can add to certain field types to save you time.

Here are the CSS selectors for all the navigation buttons that can appear on Wufoo forms: Missing Submit Button When you use an iFrame code to embed your form on your website, the code includes a height that we estimate. Unfortunately, there's room for error due to different browser resolutions or font sizes, so sometimes the Submit button will get cut off at the bottom of the form. To fix this, you'll need to increase the height attribute in your embed code. Locate the code snippet on your site, and find the height attribute. It will say something like height=""746"" . Increase that number and continue testing until you can see everything on your form. You should also make sure to leave some extra wiggle room because error messages take up extra space if someone fills out a field on your form incorrectly.

This tax applies to all SurveyMonkey products, including SurveyMonkey Enterprise, SurveyMonkey Audience, and our other business solutions . Tax Rate Local tax rates vary depending on your state, county, and city. Make sure your current Billing Details are up to date so that we can charge the correct tax rate. SurveyMonkey may not assess tax in some locations or on some of its services. If you want to estimate your potential sales tax, the best way is to use an online sales tax calculator . Tax Exemption Some organizations and businesses may be exempt from sales tax. If you believe your organization qualifies for tax-exempt status, apply for tax exemption before you upgrade or renew your account. If you've already made a purchase and still need to provide a tax exemption certificate, you have a limited amount of time , depending on your billing location. Once your exemption status has been approved, future purchases will be exempt from tax where applicable. You can check your current exemption status in the Billing Profile section of the Billing Details page. If you're charged tax after your exemption status has been approved, please contact us . Tax Exemption Certificate Timelines The amount of time you have to submit a tax exemption certificate after upgrading or renewal varies based on billing location. If you don't see your billing location in the table below, you have 90 days from date of purchase to apply. Invoices You can find your invoices in the Transaction History tab of the My Account page.

Analyzing A/B Test Results There are several areas in the Analyze Results section where you can view and analyze the results of your A/B test. Under the Question Summaries tab, you can see the number and percentage of respondents that viewed each variable. In the CURRENT VIEW section of the left sidebar, you can Filter by A/B Test or Compare by A/B Test . Under the Individual Responses tab, you can see which variable each respondent was shown. You can filter or compare by A/B test for these question types: Multiple Choice, Checkboxes, Star Rating, Dropdown, Matrix/Rating Scale, Ranking, and Image Choice. You may notice that the distribution of respondents that saw each variable doesn't exactly match the percentages you defined. The more responses you collect, the more likely it is that your results will reflect the percentages. Since variables are randomly assigned, we do not guarantee the split will be exact, particularly for smaller numbers of participants. We suggest collecting at least 50 responses. TIP! See if there are significant differences in how respondents who saw different variables answered your survey. Exports When a Filter by A/B Test rule is applied, you can only export summary data in PDF or PPT format. However, the A/B Test questions themselves are excluded from PPT exports since there are no charts and data tables to display in the presentation. When a Compare by A/B Test rule is applied, you can only export summary data in PDF format.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/advanced-branching,Advanced Branching,"Advanced Branching Video Overview Survey Requirements Adding Advanced Branching Using Multiple Rules Conditions & Actions Managing Existing Rules Previewing & Testing Rules Analyzing Your Results Common Questions Advanced Branching Advanced Branching Video Overview Survey Requirements Adding Advanced Branching Using Multiple Rules Conditions & Actions Managing Existing Rules Previewing & Testing Rules Analyzing Your Results Common Questions PAID FEATURE: Advanced branching is only available on some paid plans—see what's on your plan . Advanced Branching lets you customize the behavior of your survey based on multiple conditions and it's one of our most powerful logic features . Build conditions based on a respondent's answers, custom data from Contacts , custom variables , or survey language. When the criteria you define in your conditions are met, you can skip respondents to future points in your survey, show or hide questions, show or hide pages, or invalidate questions and customize the error message. Add unconditional skip logic to a page, so that everyone that reaches that page is skipped to a specific page later in the survey. For example, you can have respondents select only the products they’ve purchased from a list of options and then show them follow up questions relevant to those products while hiding the follow up questions on products they didn’t purchase. Or, you can disqualify respondents who answer a series of questions in a certain way, so you can screen out respondents that aren't relevant to your survey's goals. TIP! It's best to apply Advanced Branching after your survey design is finalized. Video Overview Survey Requirements Before adding Advanced Branching to your survey, it's helpful to understand what data you can base conditions on, and what collector types you'll need to use in order for everything to work smoothly. Adding Advanced Branching To add Advanced Branching to your survey: In the Design Survey section, go to the page you want to add logic to. Click Page Logic at the top of the page. Choose Advanced branching logic . Click + NEW RULE . Define the conditions and actions for this rule. You can add more rules after you save this one. Click Save Rule . Click Apply . TIP! If you add more than one rule, review the Using Multiple Rules section below for more information. Using Multiple Rules Types of Rules The Advanced Branching Logic tab is split into two sections where you can set up the three different types of rules. Section Rule Type Description Advanced branching rules Advanced Branching Rule A rule composed of a condition and an action. Advanced branching rules Conditional Skip Rule A rule composed of a condition and a branching action, specifically. Find a full list of actions in the Conditions & Actions section. If no other skip rules apply, proceed to this page... Unconditional Skip Rule An unconditional rule composed of an action only. The Advanced Branching Logic tab is split into two sections where you can set up the three different types of rules. Order of Rules and Conflicts When a respondent submits a page in your survey, all the rules on that page are evaluated in order from top to bottom. If you use multiple types of rules together, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Unconditional Skip Rule If two or more rules of the same type conflict with one another, we take action on the first rule in the list, and ignore any subsequent rules that conflict with it. When a respondent submits a page in your survey, all the rules on that page are evaluated in order from top to bottom. If you use multiple types of rules together, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Unconditional Skip Rule If two or more rules of the same type conflict with one another, we take action on the first rule in the list, and ignore any subsequent rules that conflict with it. Using Advanced Branching with Question Skip Logic While you can use Question Skip Logic and Advanced Branching on the same survey, we suggest using Advanced Branching exclusively so you can manage all of your logic in one place and better avoid conflicts. If you do use Advanced Branching and Question Skip Logic together, and there's a conflict between the two types of logic, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Question Skip Logic > Unconditional Skip Rule. For example, if you have an Advanced Branching Rule and Question Skip Logic based on the exact same condition, the Advanced Branching Rule takes precedence. While you can use Question Skip Logic and Advanced Branching on the same survey, we suggest using Advanced Branching exclusively so you can manage all of your logic in one place and better avoid conflicts. If you do use Advanced Branching and Question Skip Logic together, and there's a conflict between the two types of logic, the following hierarchy applies: Advanced Branching Rule > Conditional Skip Rule > Question Skip Logic > Unconditional Skip Rule. For example, if you have an Advanced Branching Rule and Question Skip Logic based on the exact same condition, the Advanced Branching Rule takes precedence. Conditions & Actions Creating rules is as easy as creating logical sentences based on questions in your survey, or information about your respondent. Every rule is made up of two parts: a condition and an action. You can build rules based on the following subjects. Keep in mind that some subjects will only work when you use a certain collector type to send your survey. Conditions Conditions define the fields you want to base the rule on, and how you want us to evaluate those fields. Conditions are made up of three parts: Part Description Example Subject The data you want to base the rule on. Q4: What is your age? Operator Tells us how to evaluate the subject's value to make the condition true. You can use several different operators to define the relationship between the subject and the value. is one of Value The value of the subject you're basing the rule on. This could be the answer choice the respondent selected, the open-ended response they type into your survey, or the data that we know about them already from Contacts , Custom Variables , or survey language. 17 or younger 18-20 21-29 Adding Multiple Conditions to a Rule You can add multiple conditions to a rule and use the Boolean operators OR or AND to define the relationship between the conditions. Within a single advanced branching rule, you can either use all AND operators, or all OR operators—you can't mix and match. The NOT Boolean operator is not available. Conditions define the fields you want to base the rule on, and how you want us to evaluate those fields.

Actions Actions define what the survey should do if the conditions are met. There are two types of actions: Branching Actions and Other Actions . Branching Actions let you skip respondents to a later point in the survey when the conditions of your rule are met. Other Actions let you show or hide questions and pages, or invalidate questions when certain conditions are met. Rule Type Action Description Branching Action Skip to page Skip the respondent to a future page in your survey. Branching Action Exit block Skip the respondent to the next available block, if Block Randomization applied. If a block is not available, the respondent will skip to the next available page. Branching Action End survey Skip the respondent to the Survey End Page option. The response is marked as COMPLETE when you view their individual response Branching Action Disqualify respondent Skip the respondent to the disqualification page that you select in the collector options. The response is marked as DISQUALIFIED when you view their individual response . Other Actions Hide question Hide a question on a future page in the survey. Questions are shown until the conditions are met. Other Actions Show question Show a question on a future page in the survey. Questions are hidden until the conditions are met. Other Actions Hide page Hide a future page in the survey. Other Actions Show page Show a future page in the survey. Other Actions Invalidate question Invalidate any question on a future page, or the current page, and customize the error message that respondents will see when they try to proceed to the next page of the survey. Actions define what the survey should do if the conditions are met. There are two types of actions: Branching Actions and Other Actions . Branching Actions let you skip respondents to a later point in the survey when the conditions of your rule are met. Other Actions let you show or hide questions and pages, or invalidate questions when certain conditions are met. Managing Existing Rules To view or edit an existing rule: Click the advanced branching icon « at the top of a page to view or edit the rules applied to that page. Click the down arrow to the right of any rule to edit, copy, delete, or move a rule. You can't copy or move rules to another page in the survey. TIP! When you save a rule, we convert it into a script. To understand what an existing rule means, you can hover over the script to see what each piece represents. Previewing & Testing Rules The best way to test Advanced Branching depends on the subjects you based your rules on. At this time there's no way to reference advanced branching rules alongside your survey as you test it. Testing Rules Based on Questions If all of the conditions in your survey are based on questions and their responses, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on which answer choices you select. If all of the conditions in your survey are based on questions and their responses, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on which answer choices you select. Testing Rules Based on Custom Data from Contacts If any of your conditions are based on custom data from Contacts , the best way to test your survey is to create a group in your Contacts and then send an Email Invitation to that group. When you create a test group, include email addresses that you have access to for testing. When you add custom data to those contacts, make sure that you have a test contact for each persona you based your advanced branching rules on. For example, if you use the Custom 1 field to record each contact's department, and you based advanced branching rules on multiple departments, make sure to create a test contact that represents each department. When you compose your invitation message, insert custom data tags into the message so you can refer to the set of custom data you're about to test when you receive the email. After you're done testing, clear and delete the collector to remove the test data from your survey.

Testing Rules Based on Custom Variables If any of your conditions are based on custom variables , the best way to test your survey is to create a Web Link and edit the variables in the URL to test different logic paths. Allow multiple responses so you can test the survey several times with different variables. If any of your conditions are based on custom variables , the best way to test your survey is to create a Web Link and edit the variables in the URL to test different logic paths. Allow multiple responses so you can test the survey several times with different variables. Testing Rules Based on Survey Language If all of the conditions in your survey are based on the survey language, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on survey language. If all of the conditions in your survey are based on the survey language, you can preview the survey and test the different survey paths based on survey language. Analyzing Your Results Your results in the Analyze Results section will look the same as any normal survey. If a respondent was skipped past a question or page due to a branching action, or if a question was hidden from a respondent, the questions they didn't see are marked as skipped in the Analyze Results section. There's no way to view or export the logic path that a particular respondent took through your survey. Common Questions Can I show or hide questions dynamically on the same page? No. We evaluate the advanced branching rules on a page when a respondent submits that page, so you can only show or hide questions on future pages. No. We evaluate the advanced branching rules on a page when a respondent submits that page, so you can only show or hide questions on future pages. Will my rules update if I delete or add more questions and pages? If you delete pages, questions, or answer choices in your survey, advanced branching rules update automatically so you don't need to go back to update them manually. For example, if one of your rules is based on Q1, and then you add a new question before it that becomes the new Q1, the rule will dynamically update to reference Q2 instead. However, we recommend waiting to apply advanced branching rules until after your survey design is complete. It's easier to apply logic once the organization of your survey is finalized.

Are values case sensitive? Yes, values are case sensitive. Yes, values are case sensitive. What's the difference between Advanced Branching and Question Skip Logic? While Question Skip Logic can only take one action based on one condition (the answer to one closed-ended question), advanced branching logic allows you to take multiple actions based on multiple conditions—including conditions based on open-ended fields.

You can send a survey via URL, email, buy responses, and more. Survey responses are then recorded in the Analyze Responses section of your account. Managing Survey Collector Options Collector options are settings that affect who can access your survey, how many times respondents can take the survey, and what respondents see when they're done. Require a password, close the survey at a specific date or response count, or keep a survey anonymous. Allowing Multiple Responses Enable multiple responses if you want people to take your survey more than once from the same browser. This collector option is helpful if you expect survey takers to take your survey on a shared device, like in a computer lab or on a public kiosk. Editing Survey Responses You can allow people who take your survey to edit their responses either while completing the survey or after they submit it. Survey creators can edit survey responses for a respondent from the Individual Responses tab. Manually Entering Survey Responses Manual Data Entry allows you to input responses you collected offline or to add responses on behalf of someone without an internet connection. There is no way to upload survey responses in bulk. Survey Takers Can’t Complete My Survey Read these tips if your respondents are reporting trouble accessing or completing your survey. Can a survey be saved and finished later? The survey creator needs to edit the Collector settings to allow respondents to edit their responses. Then respondents can complete a portion of the survey and return later to finish the rest. Why does the survey time out or not fully load a page? If a survey design is very long with many questions, answer choices, or images on a single page, this may cause issues with loading time. Can a respondent fill out the same question or page multiple times? You can allow respondents to take a survey more than once or copy questions so respondents can fill out as many as they need. If those options don't meet your needs, Wufoo might be right for you. Why are answers already selected when I try to take a survey? The survey settings allow responses to be edited.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/billing/downgrading,Downgrading Your Plan,"Downgrading Your Plan Downgrading to a lower tier paid plan Downgrading a Team or Enterprise account Downgrading to a free plan (Auto-renew off or non-payment) Special Downgrade Cases Downgrading Your Plan Downgrading Your Plan Downgrading to a lower tier paid plan Downgrading a Team or Enterprise account Downgrading to a free plan (Auto-renew off or non-payment) Special Downgrade Cases There are situations where you may find the need to downgrade your SurveyMonkey plan. In these cases, you can either downgrade to a lower tier paid plan, or our Basic (free) plan, with limited creation and analysis capabilities, 10 questions per survey or form, and fewer responses . In this article, we detail limitations you may run into after downgrading to a free or different paid plan . Downgrading to a lower tier paid (or free) plan What happens to my account when I downgrade? Survey and forms created before downgrading your plan, may include paid features no longer available on your current plan. Additionally, responses over a survey’s response limit may not be viewable. When you create new surveys, you can only send them with features available on the plan you currently have. If you add paid features not available in your current plan, we let you know that you need to upgrade to a different plan to send your survey. Check out the Plans & Pricing page to see which features are available on the plan you’ve selected and compare them with your previous plan. What happens if I upgrade my account again? You can upgrade your account again from the Plans & Pricing page any time. If you upgrade to a different plan than you had before, you might be limited on what features you can use. When this happens, we'll show you what features are no longer on your plan when you try to send a survey. To keep those paid features, re-upgrade your account to send your survey or form. If you don't want to upgrade, you will need to remove the paid features before sending your survey or form. Learn more . For example, if you have a feature on your survey that is only available on the Premier plan. You won’t be able to send that survey again unless you remove the feature, or upgrade to the Premier plan again. Downgrading a Teams or Enterprise account What happens to my team when I downgrade? If a Primary Admin does not renew, your account is put on hold for 30 days, in case your payment is late. After the grace period, users are removed from the team, and all accounts are downgraded to Basic (free) plans. Surveys are only accessible within the original survey creator’s individual account and survey sharing is turned off. Responses that exceed your Basic plan’s response limit will be deleted in accordance with our data retention period — 365 days from the date the response was collected. Individual account owners can delete responses over the account limit at any time. What happens if I upgrade my account again? If the Primary Admin re-upgrades their account, it doesn't automatically re-create the team. Each user will need a new invite to join the team again. Downgrading to a free plan (Auto-renew off or non-payment) After cancelling auto-renew , in most cases, your account will downgrade to a free plan at your next billing date. Similarly, if you have an invoice that remains unpaid a few weeks after the billing date, your account will be downgraded to a free plan. To keep your paid plan active, you’ll need make a payment before your next billing date or choose a different paid plan . What happens to my survey data? When your account downgrades, responses over a survey’s response limit aren’t viewable and may be deleted after a 30 day grace period. To view and keep access to all of your responses, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan again before they're deleted. You can go to My Surveys or the new Homepage (beta) to see which surveys have responses over your plan's limit. After the grace period ends, over-limit responses collected more than 365 days from the date they were collected will be automatically deleted — in accordance with our data retention policy. Deleted responses can’t be restored. However, if for legal compliance reasons, such as data subject requests, you need to access specific over-limit responses that have not been yet deleted, contact our support team. As long as your account remains downgraded, responses collected more than 365 days prior that are over your response limit will continue to be deleted. You can also delete all responses over your account limit at any time. Will my surveys continue to work? Yes, but keep in mind the free plan (and lower paid plans) may have a different set of features than what you had before. When you create new surveys, you can only send them with features available on the plan you currently have. If you add additional paid features, we let you know that you need to upgrade to a different plan to send your survey. Survey restrictions while on the free plan When your account downgrades, some paid features in live surveys continue to work, but with restrictions. Design Restrictions There's a limit of 10 questions per survey, which includes text and images . If you have live surveys with more than 10 questions, we don't delete any questions, but you may run into editing restrictions. You can only copy surveys with 10 questions or less. You may not be able to edit questions on survey templates with more than 10 questions. You can't add logic to your surveys. If existing surveys use logic, they continue to work as long as the collector was open at the time the account downgraded. You may have previously had a plan that allowed you to hide the SurveyMonkey footer. You won't be able to send your survey unless you change the footer back to the default SurveyMonkey one , or upgrade to a plan that includes that feature again.

Learn what other options are available to you in these scenarios. Downgrading HIPAA-enabled accounts Once you enable HIPAA-compliant features for your Enterprise team, it cannot be reverted back to a regular, non-HIPAA-enabled account. To downgrade, you must open a new, non-HIPAA enabled account and transfer over your surveys and data. Surveys that contain PHI can’t be transferred. Regular accounts cannot be covered by a BAA and storing data that contains PHI in a regular account violates our terms of service. HIPAA accounts downgrading due to auto-renew off or non-payment Non-renewing HIPAA-enabled accounts will be placed into a suspended state for a period of time to provide you with an opportunity to renew. While suspended, SurveyMonkey will continue to treat the account, and all data it contains, in accordance with the BAA. During the suspension period, you won’t be able to access your survey data or account directly, except for limited billing and account administration functions. At the end of the suspension period, SurveyMonkey will close your account and delete all data in it. If your account is suspended and you need access to your data or want to close your account, please contact us . Downgrading EU data center accounts The European Union Data Center is only available for SurveyMonkey Enterprise Customers. If you downgrade from an Enterprise plan with accounts and survey data located in our EU data center, you’ll need to open a new self-serve account on our US Data Center and your data cannot be migrated .

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/policy/are-responses-anonymous,Are my survey responses anonymous and secure?,"Are my survey responses anonymous and secure? Are my survey responses anonymous and secure? Are my survey responses anonymous and secure? Anonymity Survey creators can decide to collect responses anonymously or to track respondents . Personal information can be collected by a survey creator in two ways: (1) by expressly asking you for your personal details in the survey and (2) by configuring the survey collector options to automatically collect certain information. We provide several survey distribution methods called collectors. Every collector type has different settings or collector options that affect the survey-taking experience and what respondent information is recorded. All collectors allow the survey creator to turn Anonymous Responses on or off. All collectors allow the survey creator to track IP addresses or not. Email Invitation collectors allow the survey creator to track email invitations . Some integrations create collectors automatically in SurveyMonkey. An integration's anonymity settings determine whether SurveyMonkey collectors record identifying information about the survey taker. For example, Microsoft Teams records the First and Last name of survey takers, unless Keep responses anonymous was selected. Remember to consider in each case where you use anonymous settings, and whether the questions you are asking could identify a person in any case. For example, this may happen if you are only surveying a small pool of people and the questions collect demographic data (e.g., male/female, age range, etc.) that could imply identity. In such cases, you may want to describe your survey as “confidential”, “pseudonymous” or “partially de-identified” instead. Privacy Survey creators may have their own privacy policies which apply to surveys that they create using our services and that detail how they handle your personally identifiable information or personal data. We encourage you to read any such policy, or to contact the survey creator directly to ask them any questions about their privacy practices. If the survey creator has not disclosed the collection method in the introduction of the survey, please contact them to verify if the response is anonymous. Review our Privacy Notice and how we handle respondents’ personal information. Security SurveyMonkey takes our users’ security and privacy concerns seriously. We strive to ensure that user data is kept secure, and that we collect only as much personal data as is required to make our users’ experience with SurveyMonkey as efficient and satisfying as possible. We also aim to collect data in the most unobtrusive manner possible. We aim to be transparent about our security infrastructure and practices to help reassure you that your data is sufficiently protected. SurveyMonkey is also ISO27001 certified. For more details, see our Security Statement . Surveys begin with https:// which means your survey responses are sent over a secure, encrypted connection.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is only available in English. With SurveyMonkey for Salesforce, you can build automations to trigger surveys and push data back to Salesforce records for in-context analysis. Create reports, dashboards, and automate flows to take action on feedback. When you integrate survey data with Salesforce, you can better understand, measure, and react to various customer interactions to improve the overall health of your business relationships. Salesforce blocked the creation of new workflow rules in February 2023. You’ll need to build new automations using Flows or use the Migrate to Flow tool . You can still activate, edit, and deactivate existing process builder and workflow rules. Before You Start Create your survey and set up your Salesforce object before you create your mappings. Learn more in our Getting Started guide . If your SurveyMonkey plan has Power and Casual seats, you need an Enterprise Power seat to access the integration. Learn more about seats and permissions . To avoid permission issues, it’s best to use a Salesforce account with a “system admin” profile. Learn more about recommended Salesforce permissions . Access the Integration All your mappings are saved to the Salesforce account you connect to. If the logged-in Salesforce account is deactivated, their mappings will stop working. Make sure to use an integration Salesforce account if possible. You can connect multiple accounts, including sandbox environments. This process leverages OAuth 2.0 for a secure integration. This process leverages OAuth 2.0 for a secure integration. To access the integration: Sign in to the Salesforce account you want to connect to SurveyMonkey. In SurveyMonkey, select the Products icon and select Apps & Integrations . Select Salesforce . Select Connect or Connect Sandbox to connect your Salesforce account. If you’ve signed in to Salesforce, we’ll automatically connect to your signed-in account. Refreshing Sandbox environments : Your Salesforce connection will break when you refresh your sandbox environment. To keep your mappings, reconnect to your sandbox environment, then copy the mappings from your old connection to the new one. Connect Your Survey to the Integration To connect the survey you want to map to Salesforce: After adding your connection, select your username. On the My Mappings page, select Connect Survey . Select a survey title from the dropdown. You can connect any survey you own or that has been shared with you with full access. Surveys are listed by title, not by nickname. Select Next . How Mapping Works Mappings send your survey data back to Salesforce. You'll create mappings to send specific data, such as a response or survey metadata, to a Salesforce object. You can choose from two mapping types: Managed package : This convenient, out of the box option sets up object mapping for you, so you don’t need to build a custom object or fields in Salesforce to hold your response data. The mapping creates a separate SurveyMonkey Response record for each question answered – so if your survey has 5 questions, it creates 5 SurveyMonkey Response records. Learn more about our managed package . Custom object mapping : If you need more custom mapping, you can choose to map responses to a custom or standard object. You can use three different mapping actions: Create a new record, Update an existing record, or Update or create a record. For each mapping type, you can also select the following options: Sync partial responses to Salesforce : Each time a survey taker clicks Next to move on in the survey, each answered question on that page will sync, rather than syncing upon survey completion Disable active assignment rules on creating or updating Salesforce records : Active assignment rules aren't re-applied when Accounts, Cases, or Leads records are created or updated. Object Mapping Actions The table below describes the mapping actions you can use in your custom Object Mappings. Mapping Types After choosing your mapping action, you can set up your mapping. There are 3 mapping types you can use to map data to Salesforce. Create Mappings Build mappings for your survey. If you create mappings on a shared survey, the owner won’t be able to see your mappings. Create a New Record Create a new standard or custom object record every time someone submits a survey. To create new object records: Connect your survey to the Salesforce integration. Select Add Object Mapping or the Edit icon to review your mapping selections. In the first dropdown, select Create a new . Click Select object to choose the object you want to map your responses to. Select survey content or data to map to Salesforce. Map any survey questions and data to your object in Salesforce. You can select an existing or new Custom Variable to pass known info about a survey taker through your survey (for example, Account ID or Case ID). Certain Salesforce fields can only hold certain data types. Use our field mapping guide to make sure you map to compatible fields in Salesforce. If you see an exclamation mark icon, there may be an error with your mapping. Hover over the icon to review the error. Certain Salesforce fields can only hold certain data types.

(Optional) Click Disable active assignment rules on creating or updating Salesforce records . This only applies if your mapping is updating fields directly on the case object. Mapping the Response Object to Lookup Fields To relate the SurveyMonkey Response records to other records, add an object mapping. You’ll need to map to lookup fields on the SurveyMonkey Response object. Select Add Object Mapping or Edit to review your mapping selections. Click Select an Action , then select Update an Existing . Select Account , Case , Contact , Lead , or Opportunity . To associate your responses to a different object, you can add additional lookup fields to the SurveyMonkey Response object in your Salesforce setup. Add Query Mappings to tell Salesforce how to find the related records. Use a Custom Variable to pass the Record ID from Salesforce. (Optional) Add any survey field mappings to map survey fields to fields on this object. Click Save Object . (Optional) If you want to associate your survey responses to multiple objects, repeat steps 4 – 7. Once back on the Object Mappings page, click Next . Deployment Options Choose how to send your survey. You can use a Web Link pasted into your own email, or use a custom SurveyMonkey Email Invitation. There are 2 options you can use to send your survey. You can’t use a collector owned by someone else. If you want to use an existing collector, make sure to choose one that you created. Web link : Create a web link to send in an email from Salesforce or another provider. Web Links are easy to set up and allow you to use Advanced Logic and Piping to customize your survey questions with Salesforce data. However, you’ll need to build your own email template in Salesforce or your other email provider. Email invitation : Trigger a SurveyMonkey email invitation using a Salesforce flow. We'll help you create an Outbound Message in Salesforce. Then, you'll need to create a Salesforce flow to send your survey. Send a Web Link in an Email If you’re using Piping or Advanced Branching with custom variables, use the Web Link deployment option. A Web Link will let your Salesforce data inform your survey logic or customize your survey questions. To use a web link: Create your mapping . On the Deployment Options screen, select Web link . Then, select an existing collector or create a new one. Choose the object that will trigger your survey. Salesforce can send your survey when changes to an object meet certain criteria (for example, when a Case is closed or a Contact is 90 days old). You’ll use this object later when you create your Salesforce flow. If you're not sending your survey from Salesforce, select None. I'm not using Salesforce Flows to trigger my survey. Select Next . Select the Salesforce objects to map to any custom variables you added. When you send the survey from Salesforce, we’ll pull in data from these fields in your web link. We’ll also sync this data to SurveyMonkey so you can filter responses and pipe data into your survey. (Optional) Select Add data to add more fields to your survey link. Click Select data to choose your Salesforce field. Choose the object with the field you want, then select the field. Then, select Save . Select New custom variable to map the field to SurveyMonkey.

You’ll need to take several steps in Salesforce to set this up. This also protects your link so your customers can’t edit them. Learn more Copy the URL. It includes the custom variables you chose to map to the object. Go to Salesforce to complete the setup. Review the instructions below for help. Complete the Salesforce Setup If you’re sending your survey from Salesforce, create an email template and flow. You may need to contact your Salesforce admin for help. To set up your email in Salesforce: In Salesforce, build your email template and add your web link to the email body. Create an email alert using your email template. Make sure to use the object you chose to trigger your survey when you created your web link. Create a flow that sends your email alert when conditions are met. Make sure to use the object you chose to trigger your survey when you created your web link. Example : You want to trigger a survey when someone closes a case. When you build your flow, choose Case as the object to trigger your survey. Select the Case object for your email alert. In Salesforce, create a flow that sends your email when a Case status changes to Closed . When the email is sent, the custom variables in the survey link will populate with data for the person receiving the email. Send a SurveyMonkey Email Invitation To send an Email Invitation from the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration: Create your mapping . On the Deployment Options screen, select Email . Select the object that will trigger your survey. Salesforce can send your survey when changes to an object meet certain criteria (for example, when a Case is closed or a Contact is 90 days old). You’ll use this object later when you create your email message and Salesforce flow. Select Next . Select the field on your object that holds the recipient’s email address. We’ll use this field to send your survey to the right people. For example, on a Case object, you might choose the “Contact Email” field. Build your email: Subject : Enter a subject line for your email. Message format : Use our pre-built Template , or build a custom HTML message. Customize email header : Toggle this setting on to choose a custom background color, select a font, add a logo, and make other visual changes to the email header. Maximum length is 255 characters. Body : Enter the body text for your email message. Insert custom data : Personalize your email message with data from fields on your Salesforce object or your SurveyMonkey contacts. There’s a limit of 6 unique custom data tags, but you can use those tags as many times as you want. However, the Email, FirstName, and LastName fields from your SurveyMonkey contacts don’t count toward your total.

You can immediately check your collector in SurveyMonkey to confirm an email invitation is pending. (Optional) Set up reminder and thank-you emails in your collector options . These can help increase your response rates by reminding respondents to take your survey. Updating Your Email Message To change your email message after your collector has received responses: In SurveyMonkey, go back to the Salesforce integration. Find the mapping for your survey. Select the 3 dots menu, then select Edit . Go to the Deployment Options step. Select Next . Edit your email. Don’t edit or send the email from your survey’s collector options. This can cause your custom data fields and the email automation to fail. Use the Salesforce integration to edit your email. Troubleshooting Email Invitations There are a few common errors with email invitations. Here are a few things to try to fix email invitation issues. Make sure your Salesforce account has permissions to send Outbound Messages. Check your Outbound Message in Salesforce. If you see an error, confirm that your endpoint URL is correct. This should be the link you got in the last distribution step in SurveyMonkey. Make sure the right fields were added to the Outbound Message. Some fields have similar names. Including the wrong field can cause the flow to fail. Test Your Survey and Mappings Take a test version of your survey to make sure your mappings work correctly. You can review mapping errors in the Audit Log. Select Mappings near the top of the page to see a survey's audit logs or errors. You can select the iAudit log icon to view your successful syncs or select the !Error icon to view an error description. Share Mappings with Your Team Shared Mappings give your team visibility into your survey mappings for better collaboration. Share Mappings To let your team access your survey and mappings: From SurveyMonkey, share your mapped survey with your team members. Make sure you give Full Access permissions to the Design Survey section. From the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration, go to My Mappings and click the Shared toggle for surveys you want to make available. Don't see the Shared column in My Mappings? Contact your CSM to activate the feature for your team. View Shared Mappings To view the team's shared mappings, hover over the down arrow next to Connected Accounts or My Mappings and select Shared Mappings . Team members can Edit Shared Mappings but can't view the deployment options page. To get the invitation URL, team members can contact the survey owner. Copy Mappings to Another Account If you build mappings in a Sandbox account, you can copy them over to a production account. To copy mappings: If you haven't already, add a connection for your other Salesforce account. On the My Mappings page, check the box for the survey you want to copy. Select Copy to Account . Select the account to copy your mapping to. Select OK . Common Questions How do I tie my responses to a specific record in Salesforce? First, check that you included Custom Variables in your survey mapping —either your survey field mapping or query mapping, depending on your mapping action. If your variables are mapped, the merge fields in your survey URL may need to be updated if your sending platform's {Merge field} differs from Salesforce. For example, Pardot uses different merge fields than Salesforce. Check the {Merge field} in the survey URL and replace it with the correct merge field from your sending platform.

No—only responses that you collect after the integration is connected can be mapped to Salesforce. No—only responses that you collect after the integration is connected can be mapped to Salesforce. How do we keep the responses sync active if the user that set up the mappings leaves the company? Don't delete a SurveyMonkey account or a Salesforce connection with an active Salesforce mapping, as this deletes the mappings permanently and survey data won't sync to Salesforce. Instead, if necessary, first reassign the SurveyMonkey account—this maintains all survey and integration data in the account. If the Salesforce connection a mapping is set up under will be deactivated, to avoid data loss, copy the mappings over to a new Salesforce connection/account. To copy mappings over to a new Salesforce account: Add a new Salesforce connection by logging into Salesforce and selecting Add account on the integration page (the Salesforce user you are logged in as will be added). Go to Connected Accounts and select the username of the original Salesforce connection. Select survey mappings and Copy to Account . Select the new Salesforce connection. The survey mappings are copied to the new connection. This doesn't include the sync data for original mapping. You can now safely delete the original Salesforce connection or deactivate the user.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/tracking-respondents,Tracking Respondents,"Tracking Respondents Tracking Respondents Tracking Respondents Before you send your survey, decide if you want to track who’s taken your survey or if you want to keep responses anonymous. You need to set up your survey to track respondents before you send it out. It's not possible to start tracking responses after the survey is sent. Ways to Track Respondents Sending an Email Invitation is the best way to track respondents . An Email Invitation lets you track: How many people opened your email How many people clicked through to the survey Who responded to your survey When you use a Web Link collector to send your survey, you can use these tracking options: Add the Name or Email address question to your survey design and make it required so people must submit an identifier with their survey response. Add Custom Variables to your survey design to pass known information through a survey link and into your survey results. If you have an Enterprise team with SSO enabled, turn on Respondent Authentication . This means respondents need to log in through SSO to access your survey and their profile information is tracked with their response.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/analyze/filter-rules,Filtering Survey Results,"Filtering Survey Results Creating Filter Rules Types of Filters How Filters Work Managing Filters Exporting & Sharing Filters Filtering Survey Results Filtering Survey Results Creating Filter Rules Types of Filters How Filters Work Managing Filters Exporting & Sharing Filters Filter rules allow you to break down your survey results and focus on specific parts of your data. For example, you can filter by question and answer to view respondents who answered a question a certain way. Or you can filter by completeness to view only complete responses. When designing your survey, think about how you want to filter your results. If you want to see responses by group, make sure to include a question in the survey that will allow you to filter by that group. For example, if you include a question in your survey asking employees to select their department, you can filter by question and answer to view only results from human resources department. To view only completed responses from the human resources department, you can also filter by completeness. Creating Filter Rules To create a filter rule: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Select Rules from the toolbar, then click + Filter . Select a filter type . Choose the criteria you want to focus on. Click Apply . You'll see any active filters at the top of the page. We'll also show the number of responses included in your filter, compared to the number of responses in your survey. Types of Filters How Filters Work Filter Logic A single filter rule uses OR logic. This means any responses that fit at least one of the filter's criteria are shown. For example, if you're filtering by Question & Answer and select both answer options A and B, the filter will include responses from people who chose either answer option A OR answer option B. If you want to see all options except for one, you can create a NOT rule by selecting all options in the filter except the one you want to exclude. Using Multiple Filters You can apply multiple filter rules at the same time to narrow down your survey data even further. When multiple filters are applied at the same time, they're combined using AND logic. This means that only results that meet all filter rules are shown. For example, if you apply a filter rule by Question & Answer and select answer option B, then also apply a second filter rule for responses tagged ""human resources,"" your results will only show responses from people who chose answer option B AND have a response tagged ""human resources."" Combined Filters PAID FEATURE: Combined filters are only available to customers on some paid plans . Once you've created a few filters, you can combine two or more filters with AND, OR, or NOT logic to do more advanced filtering. To create a combined filter: Go to the Analyze Results section of your survey. Create the filters you want to combine. Select Rules from the toolbar, then click + Filter . Click Combine multiple filters . In the Combined Filters window, use the dropdowns to select a condition and a filter. To use NOT logic, select Does not match . Click + Condition and use the dropdowns to add another filter to your combined filter. Click the And button to toggle between AND or OR logic. In the lower right corner, click Save . Your combined filter will be applied to your results. To find your filter later, select Rules from the toolbar. TIP! You can save combinations of filters as Views . If your survey is shared with a team , anything saved in the Analyze Results section is visible to all collaborators when they access the survey. Clear names make it easy for other collaborators to recognize and use views in their own analysis. Managing Filters Select Rules from the toolbar, then click the three dots menu next to a filter rule to unapply, edit, rename, copy or delete it. Select the filter name to turn it on or off. A green check mark ✅ next to a filter means that the filter is active. You'll also see any active filters at the top of the page. Exporting & Sharing Filters You can export your results with a filter applied or share your survey results with other people.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/accessibility,Accessibility When Using SurveyMonkey,"Accessibility When Using SurveyMonkey 508 Compliance & WCAG2 Creating Accessible Surveys Accessible Surveys Checklist Taking Surveys with a Screen Reader Feedback Accessibility When Using SurveyMonkey Accessibility When Using SurveyMonkey 508 Compliance & WCAG2 Creating Accessible Surveys Accessible Surveys Checklist Taking Surveys with a Screen Reader Feedback SurveyMonkey understands the importance of accessibility on the web and empowers you to make surveys that are Section 508 and WCAG2 compliant. In this article, learn how you can create accessible surveys and how to use a screen reader to navigate SurveyMonkey surveys. 508 Compliance & WCAG2 If you use an accessible theme and follow the accessible survey checklist , your survey will work for people taking the survey with a screen reader. This means you can use SurveyMonkey to create accessible surveys that are compliant with Section 508 and WCAG2 standards. Section 508 Section 508 is a United States federal law that requires all electronic and information technology used by the federal government to be accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG2 WCAG2 is a set of technical guidelines for making web content more accessible. It includes a set of criteria to test for success. VPAT Documentation SurveyMonkey WCAG2 Conformance Claim [PDF]» Creating Accessible Surveys What is an accessible survey? An accessible survey is designed so that people with varying hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive abilities can complete it. An accessible survey enables survey takers using screen magnifiers to successfully complete the survey. An accessible survey has the necessary text elements to enable a survey taker to successfully navigate and complete a survey using a screen reader with a text-to-speech (TTS) system. An accessible survey can be completed using voice recognition software. An accessible survey doesn't require a mouse or keyboard to complete. Standard Themes & Color Contrast Accessible standard themes include the right amount of color contrast and brightness to ensure our survey designs are accessible to most people, including people with colorblindness. Our default survey theme, Heritage, is compliant with Section 508 standards. When designing an accessible survey, use a theme from the list below and don’t change the colors or style settings. The following standard themes are compliant with Section 508 standards: Heritage Arctic Iceberg Pastel Aqua Charcoal TIP! Look for the accessible survey icon when choosing a theme. Custom Themes To keep surveys accessible, we recommend not making changes to the standard themes that are Section 508 compliant. If you create a custom theme, use a tool like the tanaguru contrast finder to ensure that the color combinations pass WCAG standards for contrast ratio. Accessible Surveys Checklist To ensure your survey is accessible, check all of the following: ✅ Use the classic survey format The classic survey format with the Heritage theme is best for people using a screen reader to take a survey. The One Question at a Time and Conversation survey format are not fully accessible. ✅ Only use accessible question types and settings. Avoid these question types and settings: Matrix of Dropdown menus question type Click Map question type Accepting payments page Multilingual Surveys— People using a screen reader won't be able to select their preferred language from the dropdown menu Forced Ranking setting for a matrix/rating scale question type All other question types and settings are accessible. ✅ Add alt text to images and videos. To make your survey accessible to people using screen readers, Section 508 requires that a text equivalent is provided for every non-text element, like images and videos. This alternative text, known as alt text, can be in the alt attribute of the image or in the context surrounding the image, like a caption. Since screen readers can't read an image, they'll announce the alt text instead. You can add descriptive alt text to images in your survey. Click the links below to find steps to add alt text to each image type: Image choice question Freestanding survey images Image A/B Tests Logo If you add a video to your survey, provide closed captions with the video. ✅ Keep asterisks for required questions. By default, when you require a question an asterisk will appear next to the question. Don’t turn this option off. In the survey introduction, let survey takers know that asterisks mean a question is required. ✅ Change star rating icons to black. If you’re using an accessible theme and adding a star rating question change the icon color to black for good contrast. You’ll see a color dropdown when editing the question. ✅ Write clear error messages. When survey takers enter an invalid response to a question with answer validation applied , or skip a required question , an error message appears above the question. Customize the error text so that people know specifically how to answer the question so they can move on. ❌ Don't edit default navigation labels. By default, navigation buttons are labeled “Previous”,”Next”, and “Done,” which work well with screen readers. ❌ Don't include images that blink or flash. If you use animated content in your survey, check that it meets the time refresh requirements . ✅ Place text fields close to row labels. When a row label is positioned far away from the text field, it may cause issues for screen magnifiers used by low vision respondents. For Multiple Textboxes, Contact Information, or Matrix/Rating Scale questions, adjust the question layout to keep the labels and text fields close together. ✅ Use page titles for Heading 2 (H2). If you want to use an H2 in your heading rank , turn on page titles . ✅ Use the Email Invitation or Web Link collector to send your survey. Other collector types aren't accessible. ❌ Don't password protect your survey. The page to enter a password isn't accessible. Taking Surveys with a Screen Reader Screen Readers We Support JAWS NVDA VoiceOver TalkBack Most question types are compatible with screen readers (exceptions are listed in the accessible surveys checklist . For the best survey taking experience, we recommend using the most updated version of one of our supported browsers . Headings The following table describes what each heading level represents in a SurveyMonkey survey. Please refer to your preferred screen reader's manual to learn how to navigate online forms and surveys. When taking a survey, you can use your screen reader to navigate the list of questions by navigating between elements at heading level 4. If you receive error messages when submitting a page, use your screen reader to navigate heading level 4 to move between questions with error messages. SurveyMonkey surveys don't use heading levels 5 & 6. Feedback SurveyMonkey is dedicated to helping people create surveys that are accessible. If you have feedback on how we can do better, please fill out the SurveyMonkey Accessibility Feedback Form . We may not be able to respond to your feedback directly, but we'll make sure your thoughts and suggestions reach the right teams.

Learn more about sending a recurring email invitation . How It Works Setting up a recurrence makes it easier to regularly share the same survey and gather data over time. This collector option saves you time by automatically creating new Web Links , called Occurrences, at a frequency you choose. What's cool about this setting is that you can easily filter your results by each occurrence to see how people responded differently over time. 1. Design your survey 2. Create a Web Link Collector 3. Turn on Recurrence in your collector options 4. Get email notifications when each new Web Link is ready to share with respondents 5. Share the new link Scheduling a Recurrence To create a recurrence: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Add a Web Link collector. From the Collector Options, click Recurrence and select On . Select the frequency that the recurrence repeats —daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Choose all other recurrence details, like when the recurrence repeats, how it's determined, and when it ends. (Optional) Edit the Reminder Email Address . Review your Recurrence Summary and click Continue . Click Save on the confirmation window to re-direct to My Recurrences. Once on My Recurrences , you can set up the rest of your collector options in the Template , or grab the link to your survey in the Occurrence. Tracking Respondents Web Link Collectors track IP addresses, but this information can't really help you track respondents . If you want to be able to match each response with the person who submitted it, add required questions to your survey to collect identifying information from respondents. What does ""Repeat By"" do? When you set up a monthly or quarterly recurrence, the Repeat By setting defines when in the month or quarter you want to receive your new web link. For example: To get a new web link on the 15th of every month, choose Day of the Month. In the Start Date field, pick the 15th on the calendar. To get a new web link on the 2nd Wednesday of every month, choose Day of the Week. In the Start Date field, pick the 2nd Wednesday on the Start Date calendar. When you set up a monthly or quarterly recurrence, the Repeat By setting defines when in the month or quarter you want to receive your new web link. For example: To get a new web link on the 15th of every month, choose Day of the Month. In the Start Date field, pick the 15th on the calendar. To get a new web link on the 2nd Wednesday of every month, choose Day of the Week. In the Start Date field, pick the 2nd Wednesday on the Start Date calendar. Getting Your New Web Links Getting My New Web Link You can copy your new web link from the reminder email, or from the collector in your account. Each new web link is called an Occurrence. Each Occurrence name includes a number so it's easy to tell them apart. To get your new web link: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of your Recurring collector. Collectors with a Recurrence are marked with this icon in your collector list: From My Recurrences , click on the Occurrence you want to access. Copy the URL. Share the link. Reminder Email We'll send a reminder email each time a new web link is created. The email is sent to the address entered in the Reminder Email field during setup. By default, the owner email address is pre-populated in that field, but it can be changed. We recommend sending reminder emails to the person responsible for sharing the survey link. The reminder email can only be sent to 1 person and you can't customize the content of the email. Editing Your Recurrence Editing a Recurrence Any edits you make to the Recurrence Template affect future Occurrences only. To edit your Recurrence: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Click the name of the recurring collector you want to edit. Collectors with a Recurrence are marked with this icon in your collector list: Click on the Template nickname to open it. Open your collector options and edit the recurrence options. Click Save . Auto-Save You have to click Save when you turn on a Recurrence or edit options, but your changes are auto-saved when you turn off a Recurrence. Closing a Survey All Occurrences stay open until you close them. Turning off a Recurrence stops any future Occurrences from being created. If a collector had a Recurrence turned on at any point, you won't be able to delete the collector —it remains in your collector list. All Occurrences stay open until you close them.

Adding Contacts Add Contacts To add contacts using an import method: Click the Add Contacts button in the upper-right corner of the message. Choose an import method (described in more detail below). Name the group (the email addresses will be stored in your Contacts ). Decide what you'd like to do if someone already exists in your Contacts . You can either update contact information associated with the email address with the info in your current import, or ignore import information so the info you already have for that contact stays as is. Click Add . Read the section below if you see any errors . Please be sure to use individual email addresses and not a Listserv, distribution list, or email alias (since only one person from the list would be able to take the survey). Copy & Paste Email Addresses You can type in or copy and paste a list of email addresses directly in the Send To field. Just pop them in and hit enter. Recipient & Message Limits There is a limit to how many people you can send to, as well as how many messages you can send in one day: Sending, Import & Character Limits Import Methods Manual List (Simple Copy and Paste) You can copy and paste a simple list of email addresses using the Manual import option.

You must put the email address first: Email, First Name, Last Name, Custom 1, Custom 2, etc. Example : Here's an example list with email, first name, last name, 3 custom fields (age, gender, and favorite ice cream flavor). We don't have Jane's age, we don't have Pat's age or gender, and we don't know Marge's favorite ice cream flavor, so we'll leave those blank: bob@email.com, Bob, Thompson, 39, male, chocolate jane@email.com, Jane, Smith, , female, strawberry marge@email.com, Marge, Simpson, 33, female, pat@email.com, Pat, Lyon, , , pistachio You can copy and paste a list of email addresses, names, and custom data using the Manual import option.

Email Import You can use Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, LinkedIn, Microsoft 365, or Outlook.com to import all your contacts. If you make changes to contacts in your email account, they're not reflected in SurveyMonkey (your SurveyMonkey account is not synced to those applications). To add only some contacts or to import contacts from another email provider or site, go to your email account and export the contacts you want as a CSV file, then import the file to SurveyMonkey. For instructions on how to export your contacts to a CSV, please search your email provider's help center. Outlook.com, the free web-based email service formerly known as Hotmail.com, differs from the Microsoft Office Outlook mail application. To import contacts from Microsoft Office Outlook, first export your contacts into a CSV file, and then import the file.

Or ask your IT department if your Outlook application is powered by Microsoft 365. Invalid Email Errors If you see an error about invalid emails or that “something went wrong” when you try to send or schedule a message, it means you may have: Added duplicate email addresses Included contacts that are opted out or bounced Imported a contact list that wasn’t formatted correctly Duplicate Emails You can send one invitation email per email address per collector, by default. When you Invite More and add a contact that was already sent an invitation from the collector, we automatically remove them from your contact list before sending your new message. Enterprise customers may be able to Allow duplicate invites when they choose to Invite More. Anyone can create a new Email Invitation collector for the survey if you want someone to take a survey more than once. If you want to send someone your invitation message again, you can send them a one-off reminder. Opted Out or Bounced Emails You can’t send messages to people who have opted out or bounced. Ask them to opt back in if they want to take your survey. Then, create a new email invitation collector to send them the survey (the old collector will continue to list them as opted out or bounced). You can check for opted out or bounced emails in the Recipients tab under the Sent column. Spreadsheet and Contact Errors If you imported or added a contact list that wasn’t formatted correctly, you won’t be able to send your message. Here are some tips to fix the errors, then try to add contacts again. While there's a hard limit of 10,000 rows per spreadsheet, it may be helpful to break large lists down into multiple CSV files. We suggest files with fewer than 2,500 rows each and import them one at a time. Or copy and paste the rows of the spreadsheet using the Manual import option. Delete the header row from your spreadsheet. Any formatting of the header row can cause errors. Make sure you're using an accepted delimiter for the spreadsheet (colon, semicolon, pipe, comma, or tab), and that your character encoding is in Unicode ( UTF-8 or UTF-16). If your spreadsheet includes Asian characters, make sure your character encoding is set to UTF-8 format. If you're using a Mac, try saving your file as MS-DOS Comma Separated (.csv). Go to File > Save As > Format. Review our import, sending, and character limits for more info on special characters and vanity domains. If you're copying and pasting a list of emails using the Manual import option, make sure the email address is listed first, then you can add other info. Check out the example above. Editing Contacts Draft or Scheduled Emails You can remove contacts from draft or scheduled emails. From the Overview tab, click Resume and expand your contact group in your email invitation. Reminders & Thank Yous When you're sending a Reminder or Thank You message, you don't upload contacts from scratch. Instead, you can choose from the people you've already invited. Click Edit Recipients in any Reminder or Thank You message to remove recipients. You can remove up to 1,000 recipients. Update Email Address or Custom Data To update someone's data in the Recipients tab: Click your username in the upper-right corner to go to your Contacts . Find the email address, click the contact to make edits, and save. Go back to your Email Invitation collector. In the Recipients tab, you should see the new info. Any new messages you send will use the up-to-date info you saved in your Contacts. Export the data from the Recipients tab to use when analyzing your results. Contact details are pulled into survey results when a recipient submits their response, so they aren't updated when you make edits in Contacts. Sent Messages You can delete a recipient from a sent Email Invitation. One reason you may need to do this is if a recipient requests their Right to Erasure . In this case, the account holder needs to delete all the recipient's personal and response data. To delete a recipient from the collector: Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Open the Email Invitation collector used to send your survey. Click on the Recipients tab. Click recipient's email address. Click Remove recipient record . This removes the recipient from the Email Invitation collector. When you receive a Right to Erasure request, we also recommend that you: Delete the individual's response Delete the recipient's contact You can delete a recipient from a sent Email Invitation.

If you already have an Enterprise account, contact your Customer Success Manager. How It Works When your team has Divisions —sub-groups within your team that can be managed independently of one another—each division can have its own division library with its own set of assets. A division library allows each division to have unique assets that are different from the assets in the team library and other divisions. Division members can use the assets from the team library or their division library, which ensures all surveys meet either the team's or division’s unique branding needs. The assets that team members can see, manage, and use depend on their role , if they belong to a division, and whether those assets have additional default settings or restrictions. Only the Primary Admin and Admin have full access to view, add, and manage the team library and all division libraries. Division Libraries vs. Team Library The team library is for everyone on the team. A division library is only available to the people assigned to that division. If someone is not assigned to a division, they only have access to the team library. If an asset is Set as default for a Division, that setting overrides the team default.

If someone is not assigned to a division, they only have access to the team library. If an asset is Set as default for a Division, that setting overrides the team default. Navigating the Library On the Library page, there's a Library dropdown to navigate between the team and division libraries. The Filter button lets anyone narrow down their library by item type. Primary Admins, Admins, and Division Admins can also Filter to display items from specific libraries.

Primary Admins and Admins can add divisions for different departments, offices, clients, cost centers, or any other groups you want to manage separately or give unique branding assets. TIP! Divisions or Workgroups? Divisions help with administrative management of large teams while Workgroups help organize team members collaborating on survey projects. Roles and Permissions Roles Here's a basic overview of the roles for divisions: *Only some Enterprise plans have Power and Casual seats. Permissions Here's what people in each role can do in divisions: * Division Admins can only manage and view users, info, and library assets in their divisions. Adding and Managing Divisions Primary Admins and Admins can add one division at a time or import a CSV file to add or update multiple divisions at a time. Adding a Division To create a division: Select My Team from the top navigation. Select Divisions and Add division . Enter a unique Division name—up to 255 characters. (Optional) Enter a Description , Region , and Cost center . Descriptions can have up to 300 characters and the other fields can have up to 255 characters. Select Add division . Once your division is created, add Division Admins and add users to the division. Adding or Editing Multiple Divisions at a Time Import a CSV file to add new divisions or update existing ones. Editing a Division To edit the division settings: From Divisions , select the division name. Navigate to the SETTINGS tab. Edit the Division name, Description , Region , or Cost center . Descriptions can have up to 300 characters and the other fields can have up to 255 characters. Select Update division . Deleting a Division To delete a division: From Divisions , select the box next to the division(s) you want to delete. Select Delete . After a division is deleted, users that were in that division become available to add to another division. If you decide not to add them to a division, the users still have an account as part of the team. All surveys and data will remain in each user's account. Managing Division Admins TIP! Import users by CSV file to assign Division Admins and add users to divisions all at once. Adding a Division Admin To add a Division Admin: From Divisions , select the division name that you want to add a Division Admin to. Navigate to the ADMINS tab. Select + Add admins . Search and select users. Primary Admins and Admins can't be Division Admins. Select Add Division Admins . When someone is a Division Admin, they can see their divisions from the Divisions tab and add or manage users in their divisions. Someone can be a Division Admin in multiple divisions, and a division can have multiple Division Admins. Removing a Division Admin To remove someone's Division Admin role: From Divisions , select on the division name that you want to remove a Division Admin from. Navigate to the ADMINS tab. Choose the Division Admin(s) to remove. Select Remove from admins . If the Division Admin is also a user in the division, they'll remain a user in the division. If they're also a Division Admin for another division, they'll remain the Division Admin for that division. Notifications When someone is added or removed as a Division Admin, we send them a notification email to their account email address . Adding and Managing Users in Divisions TIP! Import users by CSV file to add or transfer users and assign Division Admins to divisions all at once. Adding Users To add users to a division: From Divisions , select the division name that you want to add users to. Navigate to the USERS tab. Select + Add users . Choose users to add to the division. Select Add Users . Why can’t I add a User? Primary Admins and Admins can add users to any division while Division Admins can only add users to their divisions. Users need to be part of the team before they can be added to a division. Someone can be a user in one division at a time. If you search for a user that you know is part of your team but see No result found , it means the user is already in a different division. Removing or Transferring Users Primary Admins and Admins can transfer users out of a division to remove them, or transfer users to another division. Division Admins can remove users from their division, but can only transfer users to another division if they're also the Division Admin. To transfer users: From Divisions , select the division name. Choose which users to transfer. Select Transfer users . You can either select: Transfer out of division to remove the users. Transfer to another division and then Select a division to transfer the users to. Transfer out of division to remove the users. Transfer to another division and then Select a division to transfer the users to. Select Save . Importing Divisions by CSV TIP! You can invite multiple users to your Enterprise team by importing users by CSV. How It Works Import a CSV file to add new divisions or update existing ones. You'll be able to add or manage users in divisions after divisions are set up. Spreadsheet Setup View our example screenshot to see how to properly format your CSV file. Create a spreadsheet in an application like Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets. Make sure you set up your spreadsheet's first row with these header fields: Division name , Description , Region , and Cost center . Follow these guidelines when adding data to your spreadsheet: Descriptions can have up to 300 characters and the other fields can have up to 255 characters The file can have up to 200 rows Division name is required If you're updating existing divisions, make sure the division name on your spreadsheet matches what's in SurveyMonkey, otherwise a new division will be created. Saving your CSV file You may be able to save your CSV file in various .csv formats and not all formats will save and import successfully. Try saving your file as either: CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) | MS-DOS Comma Separated How to Import To import divisions by CSV: Go to the Divisions tab. (Optional) Click Export CSV to download a complete list of divisions and their settings in case you need to reference it later.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/block-randomization,Block Randomization,"Block Randomization Block Randomization Block Randomization Block Randomization Block Randomization allows you to group pages of your survey into blocks, and then add logic to rotate, flip, or randomize the blocks. You can also add logic to the pages within a single block. This minimizes order bias in your survey. To use Block Randomization: Go to the Design Survey section of the survey. In the left sidebar, click Logic . Click Block Randomization . Create blocks. Add logic to the blocks. TIP! Your last step should be adding logic. Add all questions and pages to the survey design before creating blocks and applying logic. Creating Blocks A block is a group of consecutive pages in your survey. You can create up to 300 blocks in your survey. To create blocks: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Click + New Block . Select the consecutive pages you want to include in the block. Some pages may be disabled if you already added logic to them that isn't compatible with Block Randomization. Click Add Block . Create more blocks, as needed. Your blocks can't be on the last page of your survey. When you're finished creating all your blocks, click Done in the bottom-left corner of the menu. Block names indicate the range of pages included in the block. For example, a block containing Page 4, Page 5, Page 6, and Page 7 of your survey would be named Block: P4-P7 . TIP! A page can only belong to one block at a time. To use the same page in multiple blocks, you can instead make a copy of the page to use in another block. Editing Blocks To edit a block: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Click Edit Blocks . Click . next to the right of the block. Click Show block details or Break block apart . Adding Logic to Blocks You can add Block Logic to control the order in which the blocks, or pages within a block, are presented to the respondent. There are two ways to apply Block Logic: You can apply both types of Block Logic to a survey. Applying Logic Within a Single Block To apply logic within a single block: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Under Add Block Logic, choose Within a single block . Click the block you want to apply logic to. Choose a Logic Type (see the table below for details). Under Pages Affected, choose to apply the logic to All pages in this block or Selected pages , where you can choose a subset of pages to apply the logic to. Click Apply . Logic Type Description No page randomization No logic is applied to the pages within the block. They are shown to respondents in order. Randomization Pages within the block are shown in a random order for each new respondent. Flip pages On average, half of respondents will see the pages within the block flipped. Example: 3, 2, 1 instead of 1, 2, 3. Rotate pages Each respondent will see a random first page, with the following pages of the block arranged in successive order based on the first. Example: The first respondent might see 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 within the block; the second respondent might see 2, 3, 4, 5, 1; and the third respondent might see 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. To apply logic within a single block: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Under Add Block Logic, choose Within a single block . Click the block you want to apply logic to. Choose a Logic Type (see the table below for details). Under Pages Affected, choose to apply the logic to All pages in this block or Selected pages , where you can choose a subset of pages to apply the logic to. Click Apply . Applying Logic Across Multiple Blocks To apply logic across multiple blocks: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Under Add Block Logic, choose Across multiple blocks . Choose a Logic Type (see the table below for details). Under Blocks Affected, choose to apply the logic to All blocks in this survey or Selected blocks , where you can choose a subset of blocks to apply the logic to. Optional: Select Limit number of blocks to display and enter a limit. Click Apply . Logic Type Description No block randomization No logic is applied across the blocks. They are shown to respondents in order. Randomize blocks Blocks are shown in a random order for each new respondent. Flip blocks On average, half of respondents will see the block order flipped. Example: 3, 2, 1 instead of 1, 2, 3. Rotate blocks Each respondent will see a random first block, with the following blocks arranged in successive order based on the first. Example: The first respondent might see 3, 4, 5, 1, 2; the second respondent might see 2, 3, 4, 5, 1; and the third respondent might see 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. To apply logic across multiple blocks: Under the LOGIC menu in the left sidebar, click Block Randomization . Under Add Block Logic, choose Across multiple blocks . Choose a Logic Type (see the table below for details). Under Blocks Affected, choose to apply the logic to All blocks in this survey or Selected blocks , where you can choose a subset of blocks to apply the logic to. Optional: Select Limit number of blocks to display and enter a limit. Click Apply . Limiting the Number of Blocks to Display If you apply logic across multiple blocks, you can also select the Limit number of blocks to display setting and enter the number of blocks you want each respondent to see. This setting can help reduce survey fatigue for any given respondent by showing them a smaller subset of blocks to answer, while still allowing you to collect responses for a larger survey. The Limit number of blocks to display setting applies to all blocks in the survey, even if the Blocks Affected setting is set to only apply logic to Selected blocks . For example, if you set a limit of 2 blocks, the respondent is shown the first 2 blocks they would have seen based on the Logic Type you applied. See the example below: Total Blocks in Survey : 4 (with no extra pages not included in a block) Number of Blocks Limit : 2 Logic Type : Rotate blocks Blocks Affected : All blocks in this survey What Respondents See : Each respondent sees the first 2 blocks they would have seen based on their position in the rotation. The first respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. The second respondent sees Block 2, then Block 3, then ends the survey. The third respondent sees Block 3, then Block 4, then ends the survey. The fourth respondent sees Block 4, then Block 1, then ends the survey. The fifth respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. If you apply logic across multiple blocks, you can also select the Limit number of blocks to display setting and enter the number of blocks you want each respondent to see. This setting can help reduce survey fatigue for any given respondent by showing them a smaller subset of blocks to answer, while still allowing you to collect responses for a larger survey. The Limit number of blocks to display setting applies to all blocks in the survey, even if the Blocks Affected setting is set to only apply logic to Selected blocks .

The fifth respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. The first respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. The second respondent sees Block 2, then Block 3, then ends the survey. The third respondent sees Block 3, then Block 4, then ends the survey. The fourth respondent sees Block 4, then Block 1, then ends the survey. The fifth respondent sees Block 1, then Block 2, then ends the survey. Example Block Randomization is commonly used for concept testing. Let's say you're testing three different advertisements. You'll need to create three blocks of pages, one for each ad. To show each respondent all three blocks in a random order, add logic to randomize all the blocks in the survey. All respondents will see Page 1 first and Page 8 last, and they'll see the blocks in a random order. To show each respondent only one random block, first add logic to randomize all the blocks in the survey. Then, limit the number of blocks to display to 1 . Respondents will see Page 1, then one random block selected from Block 1 OR Block 2 OR Block 3, then Page 8. Using Block Randomization With Other Logic Options You can't apply Page Randomization to any pages contained within a block—that logic option will be disabled for pages within a block. Instead, you can randomize the pages within a single block in the Block Randomization feature to achieve the same result.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/inclusive-language,Using Inclusive Language,"Using Inclusive Language Main Considerations Gender Identity Sexual Orientation Race, Ethnicity & Nationality Using Inclusive Language Using Inclusive Language Main Considerations Gender Identity Sexual Orientation Race, Ethnicity & Nationality After you create your survey and write your questions, you should take a moment to make sure that your questions are written inclusively and with sensitivity to the experiences of marginalized individuals. We’ve offered some suggestions below on the main considerations and common pitfalls that people run into with writing inclusive language. Main Considerations Use person-centered language It’s important to value people more than the specific rules we have around language. We should always focus on the person rather than specific aspects of the person as it is dehumanizing to refer to someone using just an aspect of their identity. Ultimately, our language should be used in a way that is respectful, caring, and informed by how the individual chooses to identify. When in doubt, put the word ‘person’/’people’ before any descriptors about an individual or community. Consider the context of your language Unless it is essential to what is being communicated, you should avoid identifying people based on characteristics such as their race, skin colour, national origin, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, and religious or spiritual affiliation. Do your research Inclusive language regularly changes because of the terms that people use to self-identify change. Regularly researching the appropriate language to use when referring to marginalized peoples and communities helps in speaking about others in a way that is both respectful and inclusive. Gender Identity When creating questions based on gender, you should consider whether it is even relevant. If gender is relevant, it is ideal to use gender-neutral terms wherever possible - unless you know the pronouns of the reader. Additionally, you should never assume the gender of an individual based on their appearance. Sexual Orientation When asking questions based on sexual orientation, it is essential to be inclusive of all relationship statuses and orientations. As well, it is important to consider if someone’s sexuality is even relevant to the content. Some individuals may self-identify using terms that were or are derogatory, as a means of reclaiming the meaning behind the language. These terms can only be used to self-identify and should not be used if you aren’t a part of the community the terms have targeted. Race, Ethnicity & Nationality When asking questions about race, ethnicity & nationality, it is essential to refer to individuals and communities using the terms they prefer to be referred to as. Unless it is essential and appropriate to the context, avoid referring to people based on their race, skin colour, and/or national origin. As well, it is especially important to avoid generalizations and stereotyping people based on someone’s skin colour, cultural background, or ethnic origin.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/send/embedding-questions,Embedding Questions in Email Invitations,"Embedding Questions in Email Invitations How to Embed In-email Response Capture Collector Option Survey Behavior Supported Question Types Survey Design Requirements Troubleshooting Issues Embedding Questions in Email Invitations Embedding Questions in Email Invitations How to Embed In-email Response Capture Collector Option Survey Behavior Supported Question Types Survey Design Requirements Troubleshooting Issues You can embed the first question of your survey in your Email Invitation , as long as the first question is a supported question type. When a survey taker chooses an answer option in the email, they're sent to the first page of your survey to continue taking the survey. TIP! If you don't see the Embed first question toggle when you're composing your message then you're not using a supported question type or your survey doesn't meet the design requirements . How to Embed To embed a question in an email: Go to the Design Survey section of your survey. Add a supported question type to the very beginning of page 1. Make sure your survey meets the design requirements . Don't enable any option that would disqualify the question or you won't see the option to embed the first question. Go to the Collect Responses section of your survey. Create an Email Invitation . Compose your message and make sure the Embed first question toggle is on. (Optional) Customize your message . Click Next . Select the In-email Response Capture collector optio n and other collector options. In-email Response Capture Collector Option You can choose whether to save the first response from the email instantly or to wait to save the response until the respondent clicks the Next or Done button. By default, the collector option is set to Off and saves the first response upon clicking Next or Done. If the embedded question has an Other Textbox or Comment field , recipient’s responses won’t be recorded from the email instantly—the response is only submitted when clicking the Next or Done button in the browser. Password Protection isn't available when In-email Response Capture is On. To use Password protection, turn off In-email Response Capture. When In-email response capture is On, email scanner bots could click the links within your email invitation, as a security measure. These bot clicks record responses to the embedded question before your respondent sees the email. This means bots can cause misleading responses for the embedded question (including, a sole bot response, multiple responses, or varying NPS responses). When an actual respondent takes the survey, the responses recorded by email scanner bots are replaced by the respondent’s true answer. If you’re concerned about poor response quality due to email scanner bots, don’t enable In-email response capture. If you’ve already collected data with this option on, you can clean up your responses in Analyze by identifying and deleting incomplete responses related to the collector that were recorded shortly after sending the invitation. Bot answers will only have recorded responses to the embedded, first question. Survey Behavior How the first answer choice is saved is dependent on the In-email Response Capture collector option selection and whether the embedded question has an Other Textbox or Comment field. Regardless of whether the first answer is saved immediately or not, the survey taker is sent to the first page of the survey so they can continue answering the rest of the questions. They'll see their response to the first question pre-selected in SurveyMonkey. Survey takers need to click Next on the first page to save their other responses and trigger any logic in your survey. If you're sending a test email to preview the survey, we don't pre-populate the response in the survey preview since we don't actually collect any responses in survey previews . When the first question is embedded, the email invitation doesn't have a Begin Survey button. Survey takers need to answer the embedded question to open the survey in a browser tab to take remaining survey questions. Supported Question Types To embed a question in an email invitation, use a supported question type as the first question on page 1 of your survey: Multiple Choice Net Promoter® Score (NPS) Star Rating Survey Design Requirements To embed a question in an email invitation, your survey needs to meet these survey design requirements: Use a supported question type as the first question on page 1 of your survey—don't add anything in front of the question, like an Intro Page or Text. Don't use Page Randomization or Block Randomization on page 1 of your survey. Don't enable a Quota on your survey. Setting and Option Requirements The settings and options applied to the question you want to embed may disqualify it or cause it to render differently in the email than what you see in your survey design. Multiple Choice Questions Don't insert an image or video in answer choices. If you enable the Randomize, Flip, or Sort Choices option on the question, don't randomize or flip answer choices, but you can alphabetize them. Don't enable the Adjust Question Layout option. Don't enable the Question Text A/B Test option. We don't recommend adding an “Other” answer option or comment field on the question you want to embed—the question will render differently in the email. While the full Other answer option or comment field will display once the survey opens in a browser, survey-takers may not notice the additional answer option. If you changed the layout of the question to 2 columns, 3 columns, or horizontal, it'll be displayed as 1 column in the email. Don't insert an image or video in answer choices. If you enable the Randomize, Flip, or Sort Choices option on the question, don't randomize or flip answer choices, but you can alphabetize them. Don't enable the Adjust Question Layout option. Don't enable the Question Text A/B Test option. We don't recommend adding an “Other” answer option or comment field on the question you want to embed—the question will render differently in the email. While the full Other answer option or comment field will display once the survey opens in a browser, survey-takers may not notice the additional answer option. If you changed the layout of the question to 2 columns, 3 columns, or horizontal, it'll be displayed as 1 column in the email. Star Rating Questions You can use the Star, Smiley, or Heart icons on the question you want to embed, but, due to email client compatibility, you can't use the Thumb icon. Don't add Other as an answer option for comments. Don't enable the Question Text A/B Test option. Don't use image or video rating labels . You can choose a scale from 2 to 10, however, questions with larger scales aren't mobile responsive—they'll be static in the email, so people will have to scroll to see the full scale. You can use the Star, Smiley, or Heart icons on the question you want to embed, but, due to email client compatibility, you can't use the Thumb icon. Don't add Other as an answer option for comments.

Troubleshooting Issues Why does the email look different than what I see in SurveyMonkey? If you update your survey design after scheduling your message and it no longer meets the requirements, we'll send the default email template without the embedded question. Email clients can render HTML messages differently , which can cause HTML Template or Custom HTML messages to display differently than what you expect.

https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/surveymonkey/create/question-skip-logic,Question Skip Logic,"Question Skip Logic Video Overview Question Types Adding Logic Page Options Details Question Skip Logic Question Skip Logic Video Overview Question Types Adding Logic Page Options Details Question and Page Skip Logic Question Skip Logic lets you skip respondents to a later page, or a specific question on a later page, based on their answer to a previous closed-ended question. Video Overview Question Types You can apply Question Skip Logic to the following closed-ended question types: Multiple Choice Dropdown NPS Star Rating Matrix/Rating Scale (Single-row rating scale only) Image Choice You can apply Question Skip Logic to Checkboxes questions with multiple answers allowed, but use caution. If a respondent chooses multiple answers, each with different logic paths, the survey can only skip them according to the logic path of the first answer choice in the list. Adding Logic To add Question Skip Logic: Click the Design Survey tab. Click the question to which you want to add skip logic. Click the Logic tab. For each answer option, choose the page you want to send respondents to from the Then skip to... column. You don't have to apply logic to all answer choices. (Page options described below.) Choose to send respondents to the top of the page or to a particular question on the page. If you're sending respondents to a particular question, the previous questions on that page will be hidden from them. Click Save . Test your logic! Preview the survey to test all possible logic paths before sending it out. Responses aren't recorded when previewing. Page Options Details Skip logic is triggered when people click the Next button on a survey page. A page break is necessary between the triggering question and the question people are skipped to. Question Skip Logic overrides Page Skip Logic if both are applied on the same page. If you have Advanced Branching instead, see Using Advanced Branching with Question Skip Logic to learn how these rules work together. It's important to only move respondents forward in a survey—if you send respondents backwards, it could create an endless loop and prevent them from completing the survey. When Skip Logic is applied, we automatically renumber question and page numbers, if you have numbering turned on . You should only apply logic to one question on a page since the survey can't skip respondents to two places—it will skip respondents according to the logic path of the first question on the page. We suggest placing questions with Skip Logic applied at the end of a page. This helps you remember which questions have logic applied, and keeps the experience relevant for the respondent. Create a Filter by Question and Answer to see your Skip Logic paths when analyzing results.

SurveyMonkey for Salesforce is an Enterprise add-on. Contact Sales or your Customer Success Manager (CSM). Limitation: The integration setup is only available in English. If you use our Salesforce integration, you can create Net Promoter® Score (NPS) surveys and map the survey responses directly into Salesforce. You can use Salesforce reporting to calculate NPS and create dashboards to display key customer feedback. Learn more about the SurveyMonkey for Salesforce integration . This article walks you through the following steps to set up NPS reporting in Salesforce: Create a custom Salesforce object, or add fields to your existing one Add a formula to group NPS responses Total the NPS scores Create a custom NPS report type Calculate NPS scores using your report and a summary formula This is just one way to set up NPS tracking in Salesforce – your NPS program should be customized to fit your organization’s needs. SurveyMonkey can’t consult on coding issues in your Salesforce environment. Reach out to your Salesforce administrator for help implementing these features. These examples help you get started with our Salesforce integration, and you may need to make changes for your organization. Creating a Survey Object in Salesforce If you don’t already have a custom response object, create a new custom object in Salesforce. In this case, we've named our object NPS Responses. Or, you can use the same object you already use for survey responses. Your custom response object should contain the following fields: Survey Name (Text) Contact (Lookup relationship – Contact) Email (Email) Net Promoter Score (Number) Comments (Long Text) NPS Response URL (Text, URL) NPS Grouping (Formula, result: Text) Promoter (Formula, result: Number) Passive (Formula, result: Number) Detractor (Formula, result: Number) Grouping NPS Responses On your custom object, add a formula field for NPS Grouping. NPS Grouping is a formula that categorizes survey takers as Promoters (9 & 10), Passives (7 & 8), or Detractors (6 & below) based on their Net Promoter Score. You can decide to display images or text in this field. For example, you can use stars, hearts, or other icons to help people quickly identify scores. Use one of the formulas below to use NPS Grouping on your object. NPS Grouping with Images Use this formula in your field to add images to each NPS grouping. You can replace the file path (for example, ""/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=015o0000001blTH"") with a different image. NPS Grouping without Images Use this formula to group NPS scores without using images. Totaling NPS Scores Add the Promoter, Passive, and Detractor fields to total the number of responses you’ve received for each NPS grouping. You need these grouping totals to calculate NPS in Salesforce. These fields don’t need to be visible on the page layout to add their totals together. Use these formulas to total the number of responses for each group: Promoter : IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 8, 1, 0) Passive : IF(AND(Net_Promoter_Score__c > 6, Net_Promoter_Score__c < 9), 1, 0) Detractor : IF(Net_Promoter_Score__c < 7, 1, 0) Creating a Custom Report Type for NPS Scores Create a custom report type in Salesforce for your NPS object. You’ll use this report to calculate your NPS score. Calculating NPS Scores To calculate NPS scores in Salesforce: Create a new Salesforce summary report using your NPS report type. You can choose to summarize NPS by Survey Name, or filter the report to only show specific Surveys. Write a summary formula in your report to calculate your score. The formula below is an example of an NPS calculation formula. Make sure to update the formula with the correct object name and field names based on how it’s been set up in your environment. We recommend selecting Grand Total Only when applying the formula. NPS Calculation Formula Mapping NPS Scores from SurveyMonkey to Salesforce Now that your Salesforce environment is ready, you can map your NPS survey into Salesforce. In SurveyMonkey, open the Salesforce integration , then map your response data to the corresponding Salesforce fields. For example, you can map the survey name, NPS score, and any comments to your custom Salesforce fields. When you've finished setting up mappings, you can start collecting responses.

Certain questions can be customized without the loss of certification—if you see drop-down menus in the question text, click to see options that may better fit the context of your survey. However, if you make additional edits to the wording of the question, it'll lose its certification and associated badge. Badges After you add a Question Bank question to your survey, you'll see it has a little badge when you hover over the question in your survey design. The badge is just for your reference—it means your question is certified and in some cases who we partnered with to write it—and it doesn't show to respondents. Benchmarks The benchmarks badge indicates whether a question is benchmarkable. Look for it when adding questions from Question Bank and turn on free Global Benchmarks or purchase Industry Benchmarks and view them in your survey results. Your response data from any eligible Question Bank questions will be contributed to benchmarks on an de-identified and aggregated basis. You can opt out of benchmarks at any time by changing your privacy settings.
